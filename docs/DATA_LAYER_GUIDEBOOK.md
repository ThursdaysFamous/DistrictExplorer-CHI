# Data Layer Guidebook — the fleet's layer roster, in one place

**This is the master copy, in the Chicago repo (the reference implementation), covering
every metro fork.** Sibling forks do not carry a copy — not even a stub
(`docs/METRO_EXPANSION_PLAYBOOK.md` §3.1 item 11 is the authoritative list of what is
stubbed vs. not carried). It answers, for every civic-district concept the
fleet has ever considered: which metros ship it, which metros *can't* honestly ship it and
why (recorded drop rationale), which metros simply haven't yet (parity debt), and what's
in the researched-but-unbuilt backlog.

**Maintenance contract — this file is load-bearing, not decorative:**

1. **Any PR in any fork that adds, renames, or removes a layer updates this guidebook in
   the same change** (for a fork PR, a companion CHI PR — same rule as fork-born engine
   improvements). Update the machine-readable coverage map below *and* the affected
   tables.
2. **The weekly fleet-status run enforces it**: `scripts/fleet_status.py` diffs each
   fork's live `metro-worksheet.json` layer roster against the coverage map below and
   puts a **GUIDEBOOK WARN** on the standing "Fleet status" issue on any mismatch. A
   layer that ships without a guidebook row is drift, exactly like an engine fence
   mismatch.
3. **A deliberate "we will not ship this here" is recorded, never implied.** Every
   NO HONEST ANALOG cell cites its rationale; a concept a fork lacks *without* a recorded
   rationale sits in the Parity debts table until someone either ships it or records the
   drop. (This rule exists because SF's BART-districts candidate silently evaporated
   between worksheet and launch; the debt is since paid — `bart-director` shipped
   July 2026 — but the rule stays.)

The block above is the machine truth `fleet_status.py` checks — one array per metro
(keys = `metros.json` ids), each listing that fork's registered layer ids exactly as its
`metro-worksheet.json` declares them. Everything below is the human explanation.

## How to read the tables

Status key: **SHIPPED** `id` · **NO HONEST ANALOG** (recorded drop — the body doesn't
exist, isn't elected, or publishes no boundary; never faked) · **GAP** (a sibling ships
the concept, this fork doesn't, and no rationale is recorded — parity debt) · **n/a**
(structurally inapplicable, e.g. a township layer in a consolidated city).

Pattern legend (which engine factory a layer uses): **Polygon** `registerPolygonLayer` ·
**Bespoke** hand-written `registerLayer` (roster joins, shared geometry, filters) ·
**Chamber** `registerIlgaChamber` (legislative boundary + roster file) · **SchoolZone**
`registerSchoolZone` via each fork's wrapper · **CpsNetwork** `registerCpsNetwork` ·
**BoroughOffice** `registerBoroughOfficeLayer` (NYC) · **NearestPt**
`registerNearestPointLayer` (nearest-3 haversine; hover identity built in as of engine
v1.0.6).

Fleet totals: **Chicago 36 · NYC 27 · SF 16** layers.

## Concept coverage matrix

### Political / legislative

| Concept | Chicago | NYC | SF |
|---|---|---|---|
| U.S. House district | SHIPPED `congress` | SHIPPED `congress` | SHIPPED `congress` |
| State upper chamber | SHIPPED `il-senate` | SHIPPED `state-senate` | SHIPPED `ca-senate` |
| State lower chamber | SHIPPED `il-house` | SHIPPED `state-assembly` | SHIPPED `ca-assembly` |
| City council district | SHIPPED `ward` (50) | SHIPPED `council` (51) | SHIPPED `supervisor-district` (11; doubles as the county board — consolidated city-county) |
| Electoral precinct / ballot sub-unit | SHIPPED `ward-precinct` + `will-county-precinct` | SHIPPED `election-district` (~4,200) | SHIPPED `election-precinct` (`jg6x-23ig`, 2022 map; subOf `supervisor-district`, polling-place lookup link) |
| County legislature / commissioner | SHIPPED `commissioner` (Cook) + `will-county-board` | NO HONEST ANALOG¹ | NO HONEST ANALOG (folded into `supervisor-district`) |
| County property-tax appeals board (elected) | SHIPPED `ccbr` | NO HONEST ANALOG² | NO HONEST ANALOG⁵ |
| State high-court electoral district | SHIPPED `il-supreme-court` | SHIPPED `judicial-district` (NY Supreme is trial-level, elected by district) | NO HONEST ANALOG⁶ |
| Trial/civil-court sub-district | SHIPPED `will-county-judicial` (12th-Circuit subcircuits) | SHIPPED `municipal-court` (28) | NO HONEST ANALOG⁶ |
| District Attorney (districted) | n/a (Cook State's Attorney is one countywide office) | SHIPPED `district-attorney` (5 borough DAs) | NO HONEST ANALOG (one citywide DA)⁷ |
| Borough president / by-county executive | n/a | SHIPPED `borough-president` | n/a |
| Community district / board (appointed, labeled so) | n/a | SHIPPED `community-district` | n/a |
| Elected school board (districted) | SHIPPED `school-board` (ERSB) | NO HONEST ANALOG³ | NO HONEST ANALOG (at-large board)⁴ |
| Parent-elected education council | n/a | SHIPPED `cec` | n/a |
| Elected regional transit board | NO HONEST ANALOG⁸ | NO HONEST ANALOG⁸ | SHIPPED `bart-director` (9 districts, BART's own ArcGIS + hand-verified roster) |
| Early-voting / vote-center sites | SHIPPED `early-voting` (hand-curated per election; every site doubles as a secured ballot drop box) | SHIPPED `early-voting` (live NYS GIS) | SHIPPED `early-voting` (hand-curated; includes the 37 ballot drop boxes) |

Recorded drop rationales (full quotes live in the cited docs):
¹ NYC counties have no legislature — county government absorbed into the City (*Board of
Estimate v. Morris*, 1989). ² NYC's Tax Commission is appointed, citywide, no districts.
³ Mayoral control; the Panel for Educational Policy is appointed — `cec` is the honest
*parent*-elected analog and its card says so. ⁴ SF's Board of Education is elected
at-large; no district geometry exists. ⁵ SF's assessment-appeals board is appointed.
⁶ California Supreme Court is statewide; Courts of Appeal justices are appointed →
link-only at most. ⁷ SF's DA is one at-large office. ⁸ Neither sibling elects its
transit board: the Chicago Transit Board is appointed (4 mayoral + 3 gubernatorial
appointees, 70 ILCS 3605/19) and the MTA board is appointed (Governor + city/county
recommendations) — BART is the fleet's only transit board elected by district. (¹–³:
`docs/METRO_EXPANSION_PLAYBOOK.md` Part II "NO honest NYC analog" table /
`docs/archive/METRO_EXPANSION_NYC.md` §7; ⁴–⁷: `docs/METRO_EXPANSION_SF_WORKSHEET.md`
§0 + the SF repo's worksheet drop appendix.)

### Public safety

| Concept | Chicago | NYC | SF |
|---|---|---|---|
| Police district / precinct | SHIPPED `police-district` (22) | SHIPPED `police-precinct` (78) | SHIPPED `police-district` (10) |
| Police subdivision (beat / sector) | SHIPPED `police-beat` | SHIPPED `police-sector` | NO HONEST ANALOG — SFPD publishes no patrol-beat boundary (the only "beats" dataset is Parking Control's) |
| Elected police oversight | SHIPPED `ccpsa-district-council` | NO HONEST ANALOG — CCRB is appointed/citywide; oversight story lives as labeled link rows on the precinct card | NO HONEST ANALOG — the SF Police Commission (Charter §4.109) and Department of Police Accountability are appointed (Mayor + Board of Supervisors), citywide, no districts; NYC's labeled-link-row precedent is the upgrade path if oversight links are ever wanted on the card |
| Fire-service boundary | SHIPPED `will-county-fire` (suburban Fire *Protection* Districts, coverage-gated) | SHIPPED `fire-battalion` (operational battalions, 49) | NO HONEST ANALOG — SFFD battalions exist but no boundary is published |
| Police / fire station points | SHIPPED `police-station` · `fire-station` | SHIPPED | SHIPPED |

Note the fire-boundary concept is not equivalent across forks: NYC maps *operational*
battalions; CHI maps suburban *taxing* districts. Chicago-proper CFD battalion/division
boundaries are a **recorded drop (verified negative, 2026-07)**: neither the Chicago Data
Portal nor CFD publishes any battalion/division boundary — the only official CFD spatial
dataset is the station-point file the `fire-station` layer already uses (`28km-gtjn`);
the boundary maps that circulate online are hobbyist reconstructions (e.g. FDmaps),
which the never-guess rule excludes as a source.

### Schools

| Concept | Chicago | NYC | SF |
|---|---|---|---|
| Elementary attendance zone | SHIPPED `cps-elementary` | SHIPPED `es-zone` | SHIPPED `elementary-attendance-area` (bespoke — card carries the lottery-tiebreaker caveat) |
| Middle / high attendance zone | SHIPPED `cps-middle` · `cps-high` | SHIPPED `ms-zone` · `hs-zone` | NO HONEST ANALOG — SFUSD publishes only elementary areas; MS is feeder-pattern, HS is citywide choice |
| School admin region / network | SHIPPED `cps-network` · `cps-hs-network` | SHIPPED `school-district` (32 CSDs) | NO HONEST ANALOG — one undivided district, no sub-regions |
| Statewide school-district identity | SHIPPED `school-district-{unified,secondary,elementary}` (TIGERweb, coverage-gated) | n/a | n/a |
| School site points | SHIPPED `school-site` | SHIPPED `school-site` | SHIPPED `school-site` |

### Geography / amenities

| Concept | Chicago | NYC | SF |
|---|---|---|---|
| Neighborhood / community area | SHIPPED `community-area` (77) | SHIPPED `neighborhood` (NTA, ~262) | SHIPPED `neighborhood` (41) |
| ZIP code | SHIPPED `zip-code` (ZCTA) | SHIPPED `zip-code` (MODZCTA) | SHIPPED `zip-code` (ZCTA) |
| County | SHIPPED `county` (statewide IL) | SHIPPED `borough` (= county) | n/a — city and county are coterminous (recorded) |
| Township / municipality | SHIPPED `township` · `municipality` (statewide IL) | n/a | n/a |
| Park district | SHIPPED `will-county-park` (Will only) | n/a | n/a |
| Post office points | SHIPPED `post-office` (USGS National Map L38 — same national source in every fork) | SHIPPED | SHIPPED |
| Library points | SHIPPED `library` (CPL) | SHIPPED `library` (NYPL/BPL/QPL) | SHIPPED `library` (SFPL) |
| Ballot drop boxes | SHIPPED — folded into `early-voting`: Chicago's secured drop boxes (10 ILCS 5/19-6 collection sites, chicagoelections.gov/voting/drop-boxes) are hosted at the early-voting sites themselves — the 50 ward sites in the shipped 52-site file (plus the 2 downtown sites) — and the card intro says so | NO HONEST ANALOG — NYC runs no standalone drop-box program; absentee/mail ballots return by mail, at any poll site, or at BOE offices (vote.nyc / RequestBallot), all already covered by `early-voting` + the card's official links | SHIPPED (inside `early-voting`) |

## Parity debts (GAPs with no recorded decision — work them or record the drop)

_None open._ The original five debts were cleared in July 2026 — the outcomes now live
in the matrix above: SF shipped `election-precinct` and `bart-director`; the SF
police-oversight and NYC ballot-drop-box gaps are recorded NO HONEST ANALOG cells;
Chicago's drop boxes folded into `early-voting` (hosted at the same sites); and Chicago-proper CFD
battalions are a verified-negative drop (see the fire-boundary note). New GAP cells go
here as rows until shipped or recorded.

## Backlog — researched candidates, deliberately not (yet) built

Every entry cites where it's recorded and the blocker. When one ships, move it into the
matrix; when one is rejected, move the rationale into a NO HONEST ANALOG footnote.

**Fleet-wide**
- **Card-order conformance audit** — sweep every fork's result cards against the card
  content-order convention (procedure step 2a: name → identifier → representative(s) →
  location → contact → link) and against each layer's *source*: where a dataset or roster
  carries officeholder, address, or contact fields the card doesn't surface yet, either
  surface them or record the deviation here per layer. Added 2026-07 when the convention
  was written down; no per-layer sweep has been run yet.

**San Francisco**
- _(empty — BART Director districts, formerly the strongest unbuilt candidate in the
  fleet, shipped as `bart-director` in July 2026: geometry from BART's own ArcGIS org,
  roster hand-verified against bart.gov/about/bod.)_

**New York City** (from `docs/METRO_EXPANSION_PLAYBOOK.md` Part II "Future layers")
- Surrogate's Court judges — borough geometry ready; roster unverified.
- FDNY Divisions — Socrata `68m2-uzcb` is map-type (export-route geometry only).
- NYPD sector NCO names — no structured source exists (honesty rules say wait).
- Full community-board member lists — per-borough HTML, non-uniform; only chair/manager
  are machine-readable today.
- LCGMS principal enrichment for `school-site` — needs a Socrata app token.
- Mayor / Public Advocate / Comptroller — real citywide electeds, but an at-large
  citywide polygon adds zero point-discrimination (the at-large rule: link, don't map).
- District Leader / State Committee — party-internal; recorded as "recommend never".

**Chicago / Illinois** (from `docs/STATEWIDE_EXPANSION_PLAYBOOK.md` §4/§7 +
`docs/BUILD_PLAYBOOK_1.md` §2b)
- Statewide judicial circuits (25) — blocked: the county→circuit table has no
  authoritative machine-readable source (ilga.gov 403s; illinoiscourts.gov JS-rendered);
  hand-encoding violates the never-guess rule.
- Judicial subcircuits beyond Will — PA 102-0693 shapefiles exist (Cook + collar).
- Statewide voting precincts — hardest class: 102 clerks, non-uniform, frequently
  redrawn; collar-first plan recorded (suburban Cook `k7sw-w3b8`, Lake, …).
- Collar-county boards (DuPage, Lake, Kane, McHenry, Kendall) — per-county ArcGIS Hubs;
  Cook + Will shipped.
- Park districts statewide (~350) — no statewide GIS; per-county sources.
- Cook County GIS layers never wired — library/park/fire/TIF/MWRD/forest-preserve tax
  districts on `gis.cookcountyil.gov` (`politicalBoundary` server), "not evaluated" in
  the original build.

## Adding or changing a layer — the procedure

1. Consult the matrix first: if a sibling already ships the concept, reuse its recorded
   pattern and source-hunting notes (`docs/METRO_EXPANSION_PLAYBOOK.md` §2/§6); if a
   sibling recorded a drop, check whether the rationale applies to your metro before
   re-researching.
2. Build per the playbook (worksheet entry → regenerate → registration → source manifest
   → docs), and **in the same change** update: the coverage-map JSON above, the fork's
   inventory table, the concept matrix row (add the row if the concept is new
   fleet-wide), and — if the layer resolves a Parity debt or Backlog entry — move that
   entry accordingly.
2a. **Card content order (fleet convention):** the result card leads with the layer name
   (card header), then the district identifier, then — wherever a verifiable source
   exists — the representative(s)/officeholder(s), the office location, contact info,
   and a link to more detail, in that order. Deviate only where the concept demands it
   (nearest-N lists, layers with no elected officer) — and when identity/location/contact
   data exists in the layer's source but isn't on the card yet, record the gap in the
   Backlog rather than shipping it silently.
3. If you decide a concept **won't** ship in a metro, add the NO HONEST ANALOG footnote
   with the rationale and source of truth. Silence is the only wrong answer.
4. The weekly fleet-status run cross-checks the coverage map against every fork's live
   worksheet; a mismatch WARNs on the "Fleet status" issue until the guidebook and the
   fleet agree.
