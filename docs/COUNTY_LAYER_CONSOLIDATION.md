# County-Layer Consolidation — one concept layer per district type, dispatched by county

Status: **decided + fully migrated (July 2026): `county-board`, then `judicial-subcircuit`,
`fire-district`, `park-district`, `county-precinct` — every multi-county concept now
county-dispatched (42 → 36 layers) — plus `library-district`, the first concept born
consolidated (37 layers).**
Owner: CHI (fork-level — no engine change). Cross-refs: `docs/STATEWIDE_EXPANSION_PLAYBOOK.md`
(the relevance-hiding capability this builds on, §3; the collar-first rollout, §7),
`docs/DATA_LAYER_GUIDEBOOK.md` (the inventory this reshapes), `docs/ENGINE_SYNC.md` (why
fork-level matters).

## The problem

The collar-county expansion has been shipping one layer per **concept × county**: Will and
DuPage each got their own board / judicial / fire / park / precinct layers, and Cook's
commissioner layer predates them. The per-county layers of one concept are **mutually
exclusive by construction** — a point is in exactly one county, and every one of these
layers is coverage-gated to its county — so the extra toggles buy the user nothing, and the
math turns hostile as counties are added:

| | per-county layers | consolidated |
|---|---|---|
| 3 counties today (board concept) | 3 toggles | 1 toggle |
| 7 collar counties × 5 concepts | ~35 toggles | 5 toggles |
| statewide (102 counties) | impossible | still 5 toggles |

Consolidation is UI-level, not source-level: there is no statewide GIS for county boards,
fire districts, park districts, or precincts (`STATEWIDE_EXPANSION_PLAYBOOK.md` §4
PER-COUNTY), so each county keeps its own loader, query, and card — one **layer** simply
dispatches among them.

## The decision

**One layer per concept, holding a per-county dispatch table.** Implemented as a fork-level
helper, `registerCountyLayer` (grep it in `index.html`), which composes per-county entries
and registers **one** module through the existing engine contract — `registerLayer` already
accepts arbitrary `query` / `render` / `coverage` / `hoverName` / `hoverOfficial` /
`pointOfInterest` callbacks, so **no ENGINE fence is touched** and nothing rides the release
pipeline. This is the same shape as NYC's `registerBoroughOfficeLayer` (one layer, data
picked by borough) applied to counties.

Each dispatch entry: `{ key, coverage, loadGeometry, query, render, hoverName,
hoverOfficial?, pointOfInterest? }` — i.e. exactly the per-county pieces the separate layers
already had, moved into a table row. **Adding a county becomes adding a table entry, not a
layer** — no new toggle, no worksheet/guidebook/count churn beyond the entry's source rows.

## Decided semantics

- **Coverage = OR of the entries' coverages**, checked in table order (each is a cached
  same-origin outline test). Outside every sourced county the layer hides exactly as the
  separate layers did; a throwing check falls through to the next entry, and an
  all-throwing miss propagates so the engine's fail-open applies.
- **Query dispatches by containment, not by coverage**: try each county's own geometry in
  order; the first containment hit wins (they cannot overlap). A county whose source is
  down is skipped while other counties still resolve; if no county matched and one errored,
  the error propagates — so a point in the downed county gets the honest error card +
  Retry, never a lying "No result".
- **Overlay = union of all sourced counties' boundaries**, each feature wrapped (not
  mutated — the per-county GeoJSON caches are shared with other consumers, e.g. the
  precinct cards' board spatial join) and stamped `dxCounty` for hover dispatch. The engine
  contract draws one static overlay per layer, and the union is also better UX: toggling
  the concept shows it across the whole metro. A county whose source fails at load time
  drops out of the overlay while the others draw; **known tradeoff:** the engine caches
  `rt.geojson` for the session (P11), so a partial union persists until reload — same class
  as the recorded relevance-hiding carve-outs, and the query path (which refetches per
  county with Retry) is unaffected.
- **Hover-roster prefetch is all-or-retry.** The engine caches a *resolved* hover roster
  for the session (`rt.roster` is never refetched once truthy), so the composite
  `hoverOfficial.load` deliberately **rejects when any county's load fails** rather than
  resolving with a permanent hole: the engine swallows the rejection and the next
  toggle-on retries, the already-succeeded counties resolving instantly from their cached
  loaders. Until all counties load, hover omits officeholder names (district identity
  still shows); click cards fetch per query and are unaffected.
- **One style per concept layer** (a concept has one legend identity), and a **generic
  toggle label** ("County Board District"). County identity moves into the card: a `Body`
  row right after the district number ("Cook County Board of Commissioners" / "Will County
  Board" / "DuPage County Board") keeps the card order convention (identity → people →
  contact → link) and removes the need for the old "DuPage …"-prefixed labels that only
  existed to dodge toggle-name collisions.
- **Permalinks keep working.** Retired ids (`commissioner`, `will-county-board`,
  `dupage-county-board`) are rewritten to the consolidated id by a fork-side alias shim
  that runs before the boot-time `applyStateFromHash` parse (unknown ids in `layers=` are
  otherwise silently dropped). The alias map lives next to the consolidated registration;
  every future consolidation appends its retired ids there. (A hashchange mid-session with
  an old id still degrades silently — boot-time links are the shipping surface.)

## What does NOT consolidate

- **`ccbr`** — a different elected body (property-tax appeals), not Cook's county
  legislature. Concepts consolidate; bodies don't merge.
- **`ward-precinct`** — same *concept* as the county precincts but a different parent
  (`subOf ward`, not township) and a different electoral system; it stays a city layer.
- **Single-county concepts** (`dupage-county-special-police`; joined 2026-07 by
  `tif-district` and `mwrd`, the Cook Clerk tax-agency layers) — consolidation
  starts when a **second** county ships the concept; until then a dedicated
  layer is simpler and honest. `tif-district` is the one expected to convert:
  TIFs exist in every collar county and Kendall's server already carries a
  `TIF_Districts` service (recorded in the guidebook backlog); `mwrd` has no
  sibling-county analog and should stay dedicated.

## Migration plan

1. **`county-board`** (DONE — the prototype): absorbs `commissioner` (Cook, live
   GIS office join), `will-county-board` (weekly-scraped roster), `dupage-county-board`
   (weekly-scraped roster + countywide Chair). Card content per county is preserved
   verbatim, plus the new `Body` row. Roster scrapers, builders, CI workflows, and
   `data/app/` files are untouched.
2. **`judicial-subcircuit` / `fire-district` / `park-district` / `county-precinct`**
   (DONE — second pass): the three polygon-factory pairs consolidate via the
   `polygonCountyEntry` adapter (a registerPolygonLayer-style spec — loader + declarative
   fields — as a dispatch entry, so their cards moved without rewriting); the precinct
   pair's bespoke entries carry their board-district spatial join and county-clerk links,
   with `subOf`/`onToggle` passed through at the CONCEPT level (the township outline-only
   handoff is identical in every county). Every consolidated card names its county
   somewhere fixed: Body row (board), Court row (judicial), County row (fire/park), the
   clerk link (precinct). The retired "DuPage …"-prefixed labels are gone with the
   toggle-collision that motivated them.
2b. **New concepts launch consolidated** — proven by **`library-district` (2026-07)**,
   the first concept born on the dispatcher with no per-county predecessors: Cook
   (the Clerk's two tax-agency tilings, distinguishing independent Public Library
   Districts from municipal Library Funds — a Chicago click resolves the City of
   Chicago Library Fund), Will (trustees in GIS attrs), DuPage (name-only), and
   Lake (office contact in GIS attrs) as day-one entries of one toggle.
2c. **Existing concepts absorb new counties as entries** — Cook joined `fire-district`
   (40, the Clerk's fire tax-agency tiling) and `park-district` (99, incl. the
   Chicago Park District — a Loop click now resolves the city's own park taxing
   body) in 2026-07: two loaders + two `polygonCountyEntry` rows, no other surface
   changed. Cook then joined `county-precinct` the same way (2026-07, completing
   the concept's metro coverage): 1,430 suburban precincts from the Clerk's
   `precinctHistorical` L0 — and proved an entry's coverage may be NARROWER than
   its county: `suburbanCookCoverage` = in Cook AND NOT in Chicago, because city
   precincts belong to the separate BOE `ward-precinct` layer, so the toggle
   keeps hiding on Chicago points exactly as before the entry existed (the
   Chicago test fails toward "not Chicago" so a city-tiling outage can't take
   down suburban service; the Norridge/Harwood Heights enclaves verify as
   not-Chicago and get their precincts).
3. **Future counties ship as dispatch entries from day one** — proven by **Lake
   (DONE, 2026-07)**: the first county to land with **zero new layers and zero
   scrapers** — five `lake` entries (board 19 / judicial 12 / fire 22 / park 23 /
   precinct 431) plus one TIGER outline for `lakeCountyCoverage`. Lake's own
   boundary GIS carries the board members' names/phone/official email/district
   page (verified against the county's published directory) and each fire/park
   district's office contact, so the honesty rules are satisfied by the county's
   own data with no roster pipeline at all. Kane followed in the same change-shape (2026-07): five entries from the county's
   public `KaneCo_IL_*` hosted family — board members and even each precinct's
   board district ride the features; its 16th-Circuit judicial entry followed
   via the pre-built route (the enacted PA 102-0693 shapefile through
   build_embedded_boundaries.py) since only permission-locked proxies exist. **McHenry
   (DONE, 2026-07)**: five entries (board 9 / judicial 22nd-Circuit 4 pre-built /
   fire 19 / library 13 / precinct 223) — the first county with a **recorded
   concept gap**: its GIS publishes park *facilities*, not park-district
   boundaries, so `park-district` simply has no McHenry entry and hides there
   (the honest behavior falls out of the dispatch table; the gap is logged in
   the guidebook backlog). Its fire and library loaders also demonstrate
   source-side filtering: the county tiles non-district area with literal
   filler rows ('Z NO FIRE DISTRICT' / 'Z_None (...)'), includes lone
   municipal Crystal Lake city rows in both tilings, and overlays the
   Marengo rescue-squad district (an ambulance taxing body, not a fire
   protection district) across its fire districts — all excluded by where
   clause so municipal/unserved points honestly resolve "no district" and
   the one-district-per-point dispatch holds.
   **Kendall (DONE, 2026-07) completes the collar**: five entries from the
   county's own ArcGIS Enterprise (maps.co.kendall.il.us/server) — board 2
   districts (the county's post-2020-census reapportionment kept the line,
   so the County_Board_2010 service is the current map), fire 10 / park 5 /
   library 9 on parcel-derived tax-code tilings (municipal Joliet fire row
   excluded; the library tiling's municipal city-library funds KEPT — it
   records every library taxing body, the Cook shape, unlike McHenry's
   lone-row case), and precincts 78 with township names derived at load from
   the county's own townships layer plus the county's per-precinct
   polling-place assignment joined by GlobalID. Kendall also proved the
   second structural-n/a shape: `judicial-subcircuit` has no Kendall entry
   because the 23rd Circuit received no subcircuits under PA 102-0693 —
   statute, not a gap. (Kendall's board entry initially shipped
   district-number-only and gained its weekly-scraped member roster in a
   follow-up — the lag that motivated rule 4 below.) A county-specific layer
   is only ever created for a concept no
   consolidated layer covers yet (as `dupage-county-special-police` remains
   today).

4. **Officeholder sourcing is determined AT expansion time, not deferred.**
   For every concept a new county (or metro) brings in, the same change that
   ships the boundary decides — and builds — the officeholder story:
   - **GIS attrs**: the county's own boundary service carries member/contact
     fields (Lake, Kane) → verify against the published directory and use
     them; no pipeline needed.
   - **Official directory, no GIS fields**: the county publishes a member
     directory (Will, DuPage, Kendall) → the scraper + builder + weekly
     PR-opening workflow ships IN THE SAME EXPANSION CHANGE, not as a
     follow-up. Bot-managed sites are not an excuse: the dual-engine
     pattern (requests → Playwright fallback, cpd_district_scraper.py /
     kendall_county_board_scraper.py) handles Cloudflare- and
     Akamai-fronted sites alike.
   - **No verifiable source**: the card links the official body and the
     guidebook records the gap — the honesty floor, never the default.
   McHenry predates this rule and is the recorded retro-debt: its board
   card links the member directory a scraper should be reading
   (docs/DATA_LAYER_GUIDEBOOK.md backlog).

## Verification

Per migration: the standard gates (`generate_metro_files.py --check`, `validate_index.py`,
`check_engine_parity.py` — must stay byte-green, this is fork code), the Playwright smoke
test (registration count, coverage-hide, permalink stability — plus an alias-shim
assertion: an old-id `layers=` link must light the consolidated toggle), and a live
dispatch harness against the real county GIS endpoints asserting (a) each test point
matches exactly one county's geometry and (b) known ground-truth districts still resolve
(Loop → Cook commissioner district; Wheaton → DuPage board 4; a Will point → its board
district + roster entry).
