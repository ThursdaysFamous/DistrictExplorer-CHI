# Optimization & Refinement Playbook

**Repo:** ThursdaysFamous/DistrictExplorer · **Date:** 2026-07-09 · **Scope:** `index.html` (2,811 lines, 1.30 MB), `sw.js`, `scripts/` pipeline, `.github/workflows/`

**Constraint changes this playbook is built on** (owner decisions, 2026-07-09):
- The Capacitor/Android/iOS stack is **removed** (done in this PR — 80 files, −2,931 lines; git history retains everything). The app is a website (+ installable PWA) only.
- The app is hosted (GitHub Pages, `ChiDistricts.overberg.co`); **`file://` support is no longer a constraint.** Every "embedded inline because file:// blocks sibling fetches" decision in the codebase is now renegotiable. The other design values — one hand-readable page, no build step, no framework, per-layer failure isolation, sanitized external strings, never-guess/never-stale officeholder data — remain in force and this playbook works within them.

All numbers were measured against this working tree unless marked *(not live-verified)* — the same convention the codebase itself uses. Findings were produced by a multi-agent review (5 scoped reviewers + adversarial verification of all 36 findings + a completeness-critic round that added 19 more); everything below survived verification, and the biggest claims were re-derived independently a second time.

**Execution log (this PR):** Matrix items **1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 shipped** (plus the geocoder-submit debounce fix) — school-board geometry simplified, CI validation gate added, service worker switched to network-first, remote Esri loaders made leaner + more resilient, and the Nominatim/geocoder paths made polite.
- **Item 1 correction:** the plan below (and QW1) originally proposed per-ring Douglas-Peucker simplification. Executing it revealed that per-ring DP is **not topology-aware** — at ~3.3 m tolerance it produced an *overlap* (a point landing in two districts), which is unacceptable for a "which district contains you" coverage. The shipped implementation uses **topology-aware mapshaper** (Visvalingam, keep-shapes, 15% retain, 6-decimal precision) — the same tool the sibling layers used — via the new reproducible `scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py`. Result: the embedded blob 975,796 → **83,470 B**; `index.html` 1,301,984 → **409,712 B raw / 112,216 B gzip (−69% raw, −74% gzip)**; validated through the app's *own* extracted point-in-polygon functions: **2000/2000 on the repo's protocol, 0 topology breaks, 0 internal wrong-district misses, 20/20 district interiors correct**. (The all-embedded-data externalization to `data/app/*.json`, item 2/P0, is the larger separate follow-up and is *not* in this PR.)
- **Item 3:** `scripts/validate_index.py` (node --check + registerLayer floor + embedded-blob round-trip + rewrite-target presence), wired into both roster workflows between the rewrite and the PR; tested against a simulated module-deletion and a corrupted-blob.
- **Item 4:** `sw.js` fetch handler is now network-first with cache fallback.
- **Items 9/10/11 (remote-loader resilience):** `loadTigerLayer`, `loadCookCountyLayerGeoJSON`, and `loadArcGISGeoJSON` now request `geometryPrecision=6` (~0.11 m; trims coordinate payload, ignored by servers that don't support it). The two big statewide loaders (`loadTigerLayer`, `loadCookCountyLayerGeoJSON`) gained the `hasUsableGeometry` guard the Socrata/CPD loaders already had — an Esri HTTP-200-with-error-envelope no longer gets cached as a permanent session-long success — and a 30 s per-attempt timeout (shared `REMOTE_GEOJSON_TIMEOUT_MS`) so their whole-boundary payloads can finish on a slow link instead of aborting at 9 s. `outFields=*` was deliberately kept (not trimmed) to preserve `extractDistrictNumber`'s name-field fallback across TIGERweb's per-Congress field renames. Guard verified against realistic error-envelope/empty/null-geometry/valid inputs through the app's own `hasUsableGeometry`.
- **Items 14/15 + geocoder fix (Nominatim politeness):** added `preconnect` for the Leaflet CDN and two tile shards + `dns-prefetch` for the click-time data/geocoder APIs. POI geocoding now flows through a serial, ≥1 s-spaced queue (`enqueuePoiGeocode`) instead of firing up to 9 parallel requests per click at Nominatim's 1-req/s endpoint; a per-call currency check skips the network once the selection moves on, so rapid clicking can't build an unbounded backlog, and the existing per-address cache still short-circuits repeats. The search-box submit handler now `clearTimeout`s the pending input-debounce so an Enter press within 550 ms of typing no longer fires a request the debounce then aborts and duplicates. Queue verified to run serially at ~1 s spacing with in-order results.

**Execution log (PR-D — externalization):** Matrix items **2, 6, 26 shipped** together (item 6 is a hard dependency of item 2 — the roster builders had to stop rewriting the now-removed HTML blocks).
- **Item 2 (P0):** all seven embedded datasets moved to `data/app/*.json` — three boundary geometries (`school-board-districts`, `il-supreme-court-districts`, `ccbr-districts`) and four rosters (`il-senate-members`, `il-house-members`, `school-board-members`, `cpd-district-info`), extracted verbatim so geometry classification is byte-identical. Each loader now `fetchJSONWithRetry`s its file lazily on first toggle via the existing cached-loader machinery; geometry failures surface the per-layer error card + Retry, while the enrichment rosters join best-effort (`Promise.all` + `.catch(() => {})`) so a roster outage degrades to "district number + official link" instead of blanking the card. `index.html` **409,777 → 111,811 B (−73%)**. Verified end-to-end in real Chromium: the three offline layers classify correctly (school-board D12/6b → *Jessica Biggs*, supreme-court D1, board-of-review D3), the roster joins resolve (senate D5 → *Lakesia Collins*, house D40 → *Jaime Andrade Jr.*), and a forced roster-fetch failure degrades gracefully.
- **Item 6:** `build_il_roster.py` / `build_cpd_roster.py` now `json.dump` to `data/app/` instead of regex-splicing `index.html` — the DOTALL over-match risk, the `</script`-escaping and the (previously no-op) U+2028/U+2029 escaping all cease to exist. `build_embedded_boundaries.py` writes `data/app/school-board-districts.json`; `validate_index.py` was repurposed to gate the app + data files (no inline blobs remain, every `data/app` file present and well formed) and both weekly workflows now build/commit the JSON files.
- **Item 26:** README updated (embedded→fetched, offline/SW-caching semantics, `data/app/` simplification provenance, repo layout); the not-in-repo Playwright/parse5 Validation claim was replaced with the real `validate_index.py` gate (the smoke test itself remains item 5).
- **Deliberately not folded in:** SW shell-entry dedupe (item 22) and the `timeoutMs` overrides for the now-fetched large geometry (item 11) — `sw.js` `CACHE_NAME` was bumped to `-v2` and given cache-first geometry / network-first roster handling for `data/app/*`, but the pre-existing `"./"`+`"./index.html"` duplication is left for item 22.

**Execution log (item 5 — smoke test):** Committed `scripts/smoke_test.mjs` (Playwright) + `.github/workflows/smoke-test.yml` (`on: pull_request`), delivering the headless boot check the README described but the repo never carried (R4 doc/reality drift). Eight checks, all deterministic — no dependency on the live district APIs (flaky in CI): app boots and exports `window.ChiExplorer`, all **18** layers register, the three no-API layers classify the downtown Loop point against known ground truth (school-board 12, IL Supreme Court 1, Board of Review 3) including the member-roster join, and a forced `data/app` failure yields an isolated error card + Retry. Verified green locally against the real page. This also gives the externalization PR its first real CI (the roster workflows are schedule/dispatch-only and never ran on PRs). *(One CI-side subtlety worth recording: the app's service worker serves `data/app/*` cache-first and its requests aren't interceptable by Playwright's `page.route`, so the failure-injection check runs with `serviceWorkers: "block"`.)*

**Execution log (item 7 — surface silent overlay-load failures):** `onLayerToggled`'s overlay-load `catch` previously only `console.error`'d; before a point is picked `runLayerQuery` returns early, so a failed boundary download was completely invisible (silent stall up to ~28 s). It now calls `setCardError` (guarded on the layer still being on), which drops the card's `state-off` `display:none` so the error shows right under the toggle, with a Retry that re-runs `onLayerToggled` → re-attempts the load. A ninth smoke check covers it (toggle a layer via permalink with no point, fail its fetch, assert a visible error card + Retry). *Remaining, out of scope for this item:* the second-order gap R5 notes — if the user skips Retry and just selects a point, a now-succeeding `query()` renders the answer but the map overlay isn't rebuilt (boundaries stay undrawn). Tracked as a follow-up; the Retry path already gives the user a way to get boundaries back.

**Execution log (item 12 — click-path rendering, P7):** the per-click point-in-polygon + restyle cost was halved-then-collapsed. `findFeatureContaining` now memoizes its `(point → feature)` scan on the geojson object (keyed by point-object identity, which `setSelectedPoint` mints fresh per selection), so the second scan a click always did — once in the layer's `query()`, once in `updateLayerHighlight()` against the same cached geojson — is now a free cache hit instead of a full re-sweep. `updateLayerHighlight` gained an incremental fast path: it records whether a highlight is applied and a signature of the inputs the faded/base styles depend on (active-layer count + outline mode); when that signature is unchanged and the layer is already highlighted, a point move flips only the two paths whose role changed (old match → faded, new match → highlight) and leaves every other path's DOM untouched — turning the common "same layers on, new point" case from ~N `setStyle` calls (the measured dominant per-click cost) into 2. Any signature change (a layer toggled on/off, `outlineOnly` flipped) falls back to the existing full sweep, and `clearLayerHighlight` resets the bookkeeping so the next highlight rebuilds from scratch. No layer-module changes — purely the shared highlight code. `setSelectedPoint` was exposed on the `window.ChiExplorer` debug namespace so the behaviour is drivable. Verified in real Chromium (Leaflet vendored locally to bypass the sandbox's CDN egress block): with school-board + IL-Supreme-Court on, moving the selection Loop → (41.99,-87.66) → Loop → outside-all-districts re-classifies correctly each hop (school-board D12 ⇄ D4 with its roster re-joining — *Jessica Biggs* ⇄ *Debby Pope* — while IL Supreme Court holds D1), each layer keeps its own independent highlight through the moves, and a point outside a layer's coverage clears just that layer's highlight. A new smoke check (`scripts/smoke_test.mjs`, point move → District 4 + a visible highlight) exercises the incremental path in CI.

**Execution log (item 16 — tile-failure banner, R6):** the base map is CDN-served while the app itself boots and stays usable offline (SW shell + same-origin `data/app`), so a tile outage previously left a silently gray map. The CARTO tile layer is now held in a `baseTiles` var with a `tileerror`/`tileload` pair driving a dismissible bottom-center banner ("Base map tiles unavailable — your selections and layers still work."). It's **debounced** — the banner surfaces only after ≥4 tile errors inside a rolling 4 s window (a single transient tile hiccup can't flash it) and hides again the moment any tile loads (the CDN recovered); manual dismiss latches for the session. No new dependency, styled with the existing design tokens (`--warn` accent). Verified in real Chromium with the tile CDN stubbed to 503: banner appears on outage, stays hidden after dismiss, and never appears when tiles load. A fifth smoke check (`scripts/smoke_test.mjs`, tile CDN → 503, assert banner shown then dismissed) covers it in CI. *(Note: the tile host is `a.basemaps.cartocdn.com` — a dot, not a slash, before `basemaps` — so the interception must be a regex, not a `**/basemaps…` glob; recorded in the test.)*

**Execution log (item 22 — SW shell dedupe + cache discipline + font trim, P13/P-sw):** `sw.js` precached both `"./"` and `"./index.html"` — two Cache API keys holding the identical ~112 KB-gzip page, downloaded twice at install. Dropped the `"./index.html"` entry and added a **navigate-request branch** to the fetch handler: page navigations go network-first, falling back offline to the cached canonical `"./"` shell — so the manifest's `start_url: ./index.html` and any deep `/index.html` bookmark still boot offline from one stored copy. `CACHE_NAME` bumped `-v2 → -v3` (the activate handler reclaims the old cache), with a comment codifying the rule: bump it whenever any `*_URLS` list changes so a removed entry can't live forever. Verified with the real SW registered: precache holds `"./"` (not `/index.html`) + the three geometry files, and **offline navigation to both `/index.html` and `/` serves the shell (HTTP 200, map + title present)**. Font trim: dropped Big Shoulders Display 700 (verified: no display-font element requests it). **Kept Inter 700** — the playbook's "no `<strong>`/`<b>`" premise has since drifted; the footer disclaimer, verified-date, and pinned-parent legend now use `<strong>`/`<b>` (weight 700 via the UA default, no CSS reset), so dropping Inter 700 would have faux-bolded real UI.

**Execution log (item 20 — loader/route-walker consolidation, R7/R8):** two pairs of duplicated machinery collapsed, no behaviour change. **R7:** `makeCached` and `makeCachedLoaderFromFn` were byte-identical cached-promise factories (an in-flight/cached promise per loader, cleared on rejection so a Retry re-fetches); kept the single well-documented `makeCached` and repointed the five `makeCachedLoaderFromFn` call sites + the `makeCachedLoader` wrapper to it (they already relied on the function-declaration hoisting the codebase uses throughout). **R8:** `loadSocrataGeoJSON` and `loadSocrataJSON` were 18-line structural clones of the same fallback-route walker — including the single-catch-per-route subtlety that fixed a real double-execution bug (a `.then`-recursion + `.catch`-recursion pair that re-ran later routes twice). Extracted one `tryRoutes(urls, validate, label)`; the geometry loader passes `hasUsableGeometry`, the rows loader passes an `Array.isArray(rows) && rows.length` check. Net −17 lines. Verified: static gate green; a standalone unit test of the extracted walker confirms it tries each route exactly once with the right retry counts (primary 2, fallbacks 1), advances past both a failed fetch and a "200-but-useless" response, and rejects when all routes fail; the app boots with all 22 layers and the `makeCached`-backed school-board layer still classifies the Loop point to District 12 with no page errors.

**Execution log (item 21 — declarative `registerPolygonLayer`, R9):** added a factory that builds both `query()` and `render()` from a declarative `fields` list — each field is a keyed lookup (`findPropCI`, with a `primary` headline that falls back to "Unknown"), a fixed text row, or a fixed html row, with an optional `when(result)` predicate to gate a row on the extracted values. Converted the four layers that are genuinely *pure single-source polygons* — **Community Area, ZIP Code, IL Supreme Court, Board of Review** — onto it. *Scope honesty:* R9's "~250 lines / most of the nine" estimate was optimistic — a close read shows the other standalone polygon blocks all carry an async `Promise.all` join or second concern (Police District: commander roster + station-view address/phone + `onToggle` cascade; Ward: aldermen roster + precinct sub-layer; CCPSA: council roster; Congress: `congress-roster.json`; Commissioner: Cook County electedOfficials table; plus the point/nearest-N and sub-layer modules), none of which fits a pure-polygon factory without an `enrich` hook that would make it a leaky, largely-CI-unverifiable abstraction. Those keep their explicit blocks. So the raw line count is ~flat (the factory's doc comment offsets the four blocks' savings); the win is that the four now share one query/render implementation and new pure layers register in a single declarative block. `validate_index.py`'s `registerLayer(` floor comment was refreshed (now 1 def + 11 direct + 4 factory bodies = 16; the runtime still registers 22). **Verified in real Chromium:** IL Supreme Court → D1 (with the District-1 note) and Board of Review → D3 against the offline ground truth, Community Area and ZIP against stubbed Socrata geometry (`Name TEST AREA` / `Area # 77`, `ZIP Code 60601`), and the fallback branch (empty props → `Name Unknown`, the optional `Area #` row correctly omitted) — every factory branch (primary/optional/static-text/static-html/`when`) exercised, 22 layers still register, no page errors.

**Pipeline validation run (2026-07-09):** every generator script and its workflow was exercised end-to-end against live sources to confirm each still produces the expected `data/app/*.json`. Results:

| Workflow / step | Scripts (in order) | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `update-congress-roster` | `build_congress_roster.py` → `validate_index.py` | ✅ 17/17 IL U.S. House districts; byte-identical to the committed `congress-roster.json`; static gate green |
| `update-ilga-roster` | `ilga_scraper.py` (182 records, 0 errors) → `build_il_roster.py` → `validate_index.py` | ✅ 59 senate + 118 house; house byte-identical to committed, senate differs only by one member's district-office **address** (a real update — exactly what the weekly PR exists to surface); static gate green on the regenerated tree |
| `update-cpd-roster` | `cpd_district_scraper.py` → `build_cpd_roster.py` → `validate_index.py` | ❌ **scrape blocked** at the first fetch — see R11 |
| operator step | `build_embedded_boundaries.py school-board` | ✅ 3,525 coord pairs, 83,470 B; 2000/2000 agreement, 0 overlaps; byte-identical to committed |
| `smoke-test` (behaviour gate) | `scripts/smoke_test.mjs` | ⚠️ not exercisable in the review sandbox — Playwright's bundled Chromium can't reach the Leaflet CDN or the localhost server through the session's egress proxy (`net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` on cdnjs). It is a GitHub-hosted-runner gate with direct egress, recorded green there; **no code defect**, environmental only. |

**Redundant/orphaned-script review:** none found. All eight scripts are live — seven wired into the four workflows, plus `build_embedded_boundaries.py` as the documented occasional operator step (`README.md`, `index.html:2474`, this doc). The `fetch`/`clean`/`HEADERS` helpers duplicated across `ilga_scraper.py` and `cpd_district_scraper.py` are a deliberate keep-scripts-standalone choice (no shared module = no cross-script coupling in the heuristic scrapers), consistent with the no-build-step architecture; left as-is.

## 1. Executive Summary

This is an unusually disciplined codebase: per-layer failure isolation is real, stale async results are sequenced away, external strings pass through one sanitizer, scrapers are polite and PR-gated, and design constraints are written down and mostly honored. The four issues that matter, in order:

1. **75% of the product is one unsimplified data blob — and the file:// rationale for embedding it just expired.** `SCHOOL_BOARD_DISTRICTS_GEOJSON` (`index.html:2553`) is 975,796 bytes — a verbatim copy of `data/school-board-districts.geojson` at up to 15-decimal (sub-nanometer) precision, despite the README's claim that all embedded layers are mapshaper-simplified. Its two siblings actually were simplified (they're 10–15% of their source size). Simplifying it the same way (topology-aware mapshaper — **shipped in this PR**) cuts it to **83 KB (−91%)**, taking `index.html` from **1.30 MB → 410 KB raw (428 KB → 112 KB gzipped)** at 100% agreement on the repo's validation protocol with zero topology breaks. And now that `file://` is gone, all three geometry blobs plus the generated rosters can leave the page entirely — fetched lazily, per layer, on first toggle, through the cached-loader machinery that already exists. End state: `index.html` ≈ **165 KB raw / ~45 KB gzipped**, and a user who never toggles the school-board layer never downloads a byte of it.

2. **The weekly CI rewrite of a 1.3 MB file ships with zero output validation — and the rewrite mechanism can silently delete code.** Both roster workflows regex-rewrite `index.html` and open a PR with no check that the result still parses (`node --check` takes 44 ms). The lazy DOTALL regex in `replace_block` was shown, reproducibly, to be able to overmatch and delete 46 KB of live modules under plausible anchor drift; `build_cpd_roster.py`'s U+2028/U+2029 escaping is a confirmed silent no-op (it replaces the character with itself — drift from its `build_il_roster.py` original, which is correct); and the Playwright boot smoke-test the README describes as existing **is not in the repo** — it was designed and run once, then never committed. Externalizing generated data (unlocked by #1's constraint change) dissolves the regex risk entirely; the validation gap needs fixing either way.

3. **The service worker violates the project's own freshness rule.** `sw.js` serves the shell cache-first with background revalidation — but the rosters live *inside* that shell, so every returning visitor sees last-deploy's officeholders on a page whose header comment says staleness there is unacceptable. One small handler change (network-first with cache fallback) restores correct-when-online semantics.

4. **Silent failure paths and measured interaction waste.** Toggling a layer before selecting a point gives a completely silent failure on 15 of 18 layers if the boundary download fails (violates honesty rule 3); ArcGIS "200-with-error-envelope" responses get cached as permanent success on 4 layers; and every map click re-runs point-in-polygon twice per layer and restyles every SVG path of every active layer (~6,300 attribute mutations per click with 5 typical layers on).

---

## 2. Performance Optimization Plan

### 2.1 Payload & startup

**P0 — Externalize the embedded data; fetch lazily per layer** *(unlocked by the file:// constraint removal)*
`index.html` embeds 1,136,613 bytes of data across three geometry blobs (lines 2553/2620/2658: 975,796 + 99,810 + 61,009 B) and three generated rosters (`IL_SENATE_MEMBERS` 18,080 B, `IL_HOUSE_MEMBERS` 36,058 B, `CPD_DISTRICT_INFO` currently a 32-byte placeholder). Every visitor downloads and evaluates all of it (measured: ~38 ms script-eval for the JSON.parse lines on desktop Node, est. 150–300 ms on low-end mobile WebViews) even though all three geometry layers are off by default.

Move each dataset to `data/app/<name>.json`, and have the loaders fetch them with the machinery that already exists — this is a ~10-line change per layer because the cached-loader pattern is already promise-shaped:

```js
// before (index.html:2554-2556)
var loadSchoolBoardDistricts = makeCached(function () {
  return Promise.resolve(SCHOOL_BOARD_DISTRICTS_GEOJSON);
});
// after
var loadSchoolBoardDistricts = makeCached(function () {
  return fetchJSONWithRetry("data/app/school-board-districts.json", {}, 2);
});
```

Effects: `index.html` drops to ~165 KB raw (~45 KB gzip); first paint stops paying for data; each dataset downloads only when its layer first toggles on, with the existing per-layer error card + Retry as the failure surface; the roster builder scripts stop rewriting HTML entirely (see R1); and same-origin fetches need no CORS. Two things to preserve deliberately: (a) the three formerly-embedded layers stop working *offline-first* unless the SW caches `data/app/*` — cache the **geometry** files cache-first (boundaries change ~once a decade) and the **roster** files network-first (same rule as R-sw below); (b) update the six now-obsolete "embedded inline (not fetched)" comments and the README's offline paragraph in the same PR.

**P1 — Simplify the school-board geometry regardless (measured: −918 KB raw standalone; −94% of the fetched file after P0).**
Whether embedded or externalized, the school-board geometry is 24,904 coordinate pairs at 14–15 decimals for 20 districts. Its siblings were topology-simplified to 4,771 and 2,916 pairs at 5 decimals (10.2%/14.4% keep — `index.html:2605-2619` documents the treatment and its 2,000-point validation; the README extends that claim, incorrectly, to all embedded layers). **Shipped** (see Execution log — the simplifier must be topology-aware; per-ring DP was found to create district overlaps):

| | Coord pairs | Bytes | index.html raw | index.html gzip |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | Coord pairs | Blob bytes | index.html raw | index.html gzip |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Today | 24,904 | 975,796 | 1,301,984 | 427,836 |
| 6dp rounding only (topology-preserving, 100% agreement) | 24,904 | 570,353 | 896,595 | 233,544 |
| **Shipped:** mapshaper topology-aware + 6dp | 3,525 | 83,470 | 409,712 | 112,216 |

Validation of the shipped result, run through the app's *own* extracted `pointInGeometry`/`findFeatureContaining`: **2000/2000 on the repo's protocol** (100%); over 6,000 random points, **0 points in >1 district** (topology intact), **0 internal wrong-district misses**, and **all 20 district interiors correct** — the only stringent-test disagreement (~0.02%) is an outer-edge boundary point (in no district → district 1), below GPS error. Two options were rejected: **per-ring Douglas-Peucker** (the smaller ~58 KB it produces is *not topology-safe* — it created a district overlap at ~3.3 m, verified) and **6dp-rounding-only** (perfectly safe but only −45% gzip). mapshaper is the tool the sibling layers already used; regeneration is reproducible via `scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py`.

### 2.2 Network

**P2 — Stop shipping the national congress roster to every browser.**
`index.html:2195-2197` fetches `https://unitedstates.github.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.json` — all ~538 members with every term each has ever served, multi-MB raw *(not live-verified; sandbox egress blocked)* — then filters client-side (2218-2222) for one IL representative, using ≤ ~200 bytes of it. Verifier correction folded in: the browser HTTP cache does mitigate repeats (GitHub Pages serves ETag/max-age), so the cost is per cold cache, not per session — but the first toggle on any device still pays the full download. The repo already owns the right pattern: build-time roster embedding with a weekly PR-gated refresh (ILGA: 59+118 members; CPD: 22 districts). A `scripts/build_congress_roster.py` producing IL's 17 reps (~3–4 KB, becoming `data/app/congress-roster.json` after P0) removes the layer's runtime dependency on a third-party host entirely.

**P3 — Ask Esri servers for display-precision geometry.**
`loadTigerLayer` (`index.html:2115-2120`), `loadArcGISGeoJSON` (1607), and `loadCookCountyLayerGeoJSON` (2710-2711) all fetch full-precision coordinates with `outFields=*`. Adding `&geometryPrecision=6` (≈11 cm) cuts coordinate payload ~40% (measured proxy: digits beyond 6dp are 41.5% of raw GeoJSON bytes on the full-precision layer analyzed locally); servers that don't support the param ignore it. `outFields` can shrink to the fields actually read (`CONGRESS_DISTRICT_FIELDS` at 2198, `districtFields` at 2534, commissioner fields at 2725). Six layers benefit (congress, il-senate, il-house, police-district, police-station, commissioner). Exact diff in §5 QW4.

**P4 — Give big payloads a bigger timeout than a 1-row probe.**
`fetchJSONWithRetry` supports `opts.timeoutMs` (`index.html:711`) but none of the 9 call sites overrides it — a 9 s whole-body budget applies equally to a 1-row Socrata probe and the statewide IL House boundary download, so slow links can *never* load the big layers (each retry re-aborts at 9 s), while the Socrata 3-route ladder can keep a "Loading…" spinner alive ~65 s before failing. Give the known-large loaders (TIGERweb, Cook County, ArcGIS, congress roster until P2) `{timeoutMs: 30000}` and consider dropping route-ladder retries to tighten worst-case failure to under ~30 s.

**P5 — Guard the two unguarded Esri loaders (a 200-response bug becomes a session-long outage).**
ArcGIS REST returns HTTP 200 with a JSON error envelope under load — the exact "succeeded but useless" mode the code already defends against for Socrata (`hasUsableGeometry` at 1566) and CPD ArcGIS (1610). `loadTigerLayer` (2119) and `loadCookCountyLayerGeoJSON` (2712) skip the guard, and `makeCached` retains resolved promises forever — so one bad 200 kills congress/il-senate/il-house/commissioner for the whole session with no Retry path. Two one-line `.then` additions reusing the existing guard.

**P6 — Serialize POI geocoding (up to 9 concurrent Nominatim hits per click today).**
9 of 18 layers define `pointOfInterest`; a click with them active fires up to 9 parallel `geocodePoiAddress` requests (18 with retries) at a shared public service with a 1 req/s policy — the *search* geocoder respects it (550 ms debounce, comment at 1036), the POI path doesn't. The per-address cache (`poiGeocodeCache`, 1250) already prevents repeats; add a small promise queue with ≥1 s spacing in front of the fetch (pins already appear asynchronously, so latency is tolerable).

### 2.3 Interaction & rendering

**P7 — One PIP scan and two path restyles per click, not two scans and ~630 restyles.**
Measured today (5 typical layers on: community areas 77, ZIPs ~61, wards 50, police 22, school zones ~420): every click runs `findFeatureContaining` **twice** per layer (once in `mod.query`, again in `updateLayerHighlight` at 1218 on the same cached geojson) and then `eachLayer`+`setStyle` over *every* sub-layer (1223-1234) — ~630 `setStyle` × ~10 attributes ≈ 6,300 SVG attribute mutations + 630 classList ops per click. Fix in the shared code, no module changes: (a) memoize `(point → feature)` on the geojson object so query and highlight share one scan; (b) when only the selection moved, restyle just the previous match and the new match — the faded/base style of the other ~628 paths is unchanged unless the *active-layer count* changed; (c) optional: per-feature bbox pre-check (0.105 ms → 0.004 ms per school-board scan, measured).

**P8 — Toggle path does the same full sweep, plus a DOM reorder of every path.**
`onLayerToggled` → `refreshActiveLayerOpacities` re-runs `updateLayerHighlight` (full PIP + full restyle) for every active layer, then `reorderActiveLayers` `bringToFront()`s each layer (~630 `appendChild`s) — including on toggle-**off** (1401-1402), where the layer being removed doesn't need restyling at all. Opacity rescaling only needs `setStyle({fillOpacity})` per path, not the full highlight recomputation; and the highlight of *other* layers is unaffected by a toggle.

**P9 — The highlight drop-shadow is a hidden rasterization tax.**
`.chi-region-highlight` (`index.html:525-528`) applies stacked `drop-shadow()` filters to a raw SVG path; at z15 the largest highlighted district's filter region is ~13.9 Mpx, re-rasterized during pan/zoom. Cheapest fix if pan jank is observed on low-end devices: drop the filter during `movestart`/`moveend`, or trade the shadow for a non-filter treatment (wider casing stroke). Cosmetic decision — flagging the mechanism so it's a choice.

**P10 — Canvas rendering for the many-polygon layers — with a named trade-off.**
No `renderer`/`preferCanvas` option exists in the file; all ~1,000 polygons (all layers on) are SVG DOM paths, ~500 of them from the school-zone layers. Per-layer `renderer: L.canvas()` on the three school-zone + two CPS-network layers would remove most paths — **but** the highlight mechanism mutates `subLayer._path.classList` (1226-1229), which doesn't exist under canvas, so the drop-shadow highlight would need the setStyle-only fallback on those layers. Do after P7/P8; only if profiling still shows restyle cost.

**P11 — Release the Leaflet layer graph on toggle-off (keep the geojson).**
Toggle-off keeps `rt.overlayLayer` forever — ~2 MB of `L.LatLng` objects for school-board alone (measured), unbounded across an 18-layer session. Keep the raw-geojson promise caches (they're what make re-toggle instant and are shared with `query()` — verified deliberate), but null out the Leaflet object on toggle-off and rebuild from `rt.geojson` on re-toggle. After P1's simplification this shrinks ~10×, so it's a "nice when touching that code" item.

### 2.4 Delivery & caching

**P-sw — `sw.js` currently guarantees stale rosters for returning visitors — invert the shell strategy.**
The shell (which *contains* the rosters until P0) is served cache-first with background revalidation (`sw.js:49-62`), so every visit after a roster deploy shows the previous roster — directly against the never-stale rule in the file's own header. Network-first with cache fallback restores plain-page-load semantics online and keeps offline boot. Exact diff in §5 QW2. Post-P0 the same policy question moves to `data/app/*`: geometry cache-first, rosters network-first. Also: drop the duplicate `"./index.html"` shell entry (`"./"` and `"./index.html"` are two Cache API keys holding identical 1.3 MB bodies — 2.6 MB stored, and the typical install re-downloads one of them (~428 KB gzip) redundantly), and bump `CACHE_NAME` whenever `SHELL_URLS` changes (the activate handler only deletes *other-named* caches, so removed URLs otherwise live forever).

**P12 — Warm the tile CDN connections.**
Only Google Fonts gets preconnects (`index.html:13-14`), but first map paint is gated on DNS+TLS to `{a-d}.basemaps.cartocdn.com` (tile layer created at 773, immediately at script run). Preconnect two tile shards + dns-prefetch the click-time API origins. Exact diff in §5 QW5.

**P13 — Trim two unused font weights.**
Line 15 requests 10 weights; the stylesheet uses 400/500/600/800/900 and there's no `<strong>`/`<b>`. Dropping Big Shoulders 700 and Inter 700 saves two font files and nothing else changes.

**Anti-finding, recorded so nobody "fixes" it:** `leaflet.js` at line 615 does **not** need `defer`. Lines 1–616 are only 19,297 bytes, so the preload scanner discovers it in the first ~19 KB and fetches it in parallel with the (long) HTML download; the inline classic-script IIFE at 617 depends on `L` synchronously, so adding `defer` would *break* boot, not speed it.

## 3. Refactoring & Code Quality

### 3.1 The generated-data pipeline (highest-risk area of the repo)

**R1 — Builders should emit data files, not rewrite a 1.3 MB HTML file** *(structural fix; unlocked by P0)*.
Today `build_il_roster.py`/`build_cpd_roster.py` locate JS object literals inside `index.html` with a lazy DOTALL regex (`replace_block`, `build_il_roster.py:99-103`) and splice replacements in. The review reproduced a plausible-anchor-drift scenario where that regex overmatches and **silently deletes 46,753 bytes of live modules** (a failure mode this repo has already experienced once — `docs/BUILD_PLAYBOOK_1.md` records a module deleted by an earlier rewrite). Two builders also carry drifted copies of the same machinery: `build_cpd_roster.py`'s U+2028/U+2029 escaping is a **confirmed no-op** (it replaces the raw character with the same raw character — `cat -A` shows it; `build_il_roster.py:82` is correct). After P0, builders write `data/app/*.json` with `json.dump` and never touch HTML: the regex, the `</script`-escaping subtlety, and the drift risk all cease to exist. Until P0 lands: fix the U+2028 line (rewrite it fresh — the buggy line contains invisible characters, do not copy-paste), extract the shared `js_string`/`replace_block` into one imported module, and make `replace_block` fail on multiple matches.

**R2 — Make the geometry blobs regenerable.**
Verified: zero scripts reference the three embedded geometry variables; the school-board blob is canonically identical to its `data/` file (i.e., embedded-by-copy, never simplified), while the other two exist only as simplified snapshots of a mapshaper run nobody can repeat. Commit `scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py` (or post-P0, `build_app_data.py`) that goes `data/*.geojson → simplify → round → data/app/*.json`, with the tolerance and validation protocol recorded in the script. The README's "Embedded boundary layers are topology-preserving simplifications" claim becomes true again (today it is false for school-board).

**R3 — Put validation between "bot rewrote the file" and "PR opened."**
Both workflows go straight from the rewrite to `gh pr create` with zero checks. Minimum bar, both < 1 s: `node --check` on the extracted inline script (44 ms measured — catches syntax death) + an output-side invariant check in the builders (count of `registerLayer(` blocks and dataset completeness after the rewrite, mirroring the input-side guards that already exist at `build_il_roster.py:119-126` and `build_cpd_roster.py:109-115`). Also extend the CPD guard to require a minimum count of non-null `commanderName`s — today a CPD site reword that nulls every commander sails through the district-count check. §5 QW3 has the exact workflow step.

**R4 — Commit the smoke test that the README already claims exists.**
`README.md:91-93` describes headless validation (node --check, parse5, Playwright boot + known-point district assertions) in the present tense; none of it is in the repo — it was built and run once during development, then not committed (`docs/BUILD_PLAYBOOK_1.md` prose is the only trace). A ~40-line Playwright job on `pull_request` — boot, assert 18 layers registered via the already-exported `window.ChiExplorer`, click a known point, assert the three local layers' district answers — is the single highest-leverage DevEx investment here, and it makes R3's PRs trustworthy rather than merely syntax-valid. Until it exists, the README section should be reworded to past tense (doc/reality drift).

### 3.2 Failure honesty (the app's own rule 3)

**R5 — Overlay-load failure before a point is selected is completely silent on 15 of 18 layers.**
Verified repro: toggle a network layer on before tapping the map; if the boundary download fails, `onLayerToggled`'s catch (1423-1426) only `console.error`s and resets `rt.overlayLoaded` — no card state (cards aren't visible pre-point), no map-side signal, no auto-retry; the user just never sees boundaries and has no idea. Worst-case silent stall ≈ 28.5 s of nothing. Surface it: set a card-visible error state (the framework already has `setCardError` + Retry) and/or a small toast near the toggle: "Couldn't load [layer] boundaries — tap to retry." Related second-order gap: after a transient failure, nothing re-attempts the overlay except a manual re-toggle, even when a later `query()` for the same layer succeeds.

**R6 — Silent gray map when tiles fail.**
Zero `tileerror` handlers (grep-verified); offline users get a booted app (the SW shell works offline) over an empty gray map with no explanation. One `tileLayer.on("tileerror", …)` debounced into a dismissible banner ("Base map unavailable — selections still work") keeps the app honest in its most likely offline state.

### 3.3 Code consolidation

**R7 — Delete the duplicate cached-loader factory.** `makeCached` (2081-2089) is semantically identical to `makeCachedLoaderFromFn` (1581-1592) — 9 duplicated lines; 3 vs 10 call sites (verifier-corrected counts). Keep one, rename for clarity. §5 has the exact edit.

**R8 — Extract the Socrata route-walker.** `loadSocrataGeoJSON` (1560-1577) and `loadSocrataJSON` (2093-2110) are 18-line structural clones with the same single-catch-per-route subtlety (a past bug fix documented in one and inherited silently by the other). One `tryRoutes(urls, validate)` used by both. Verifier correction recorded: the four ArcGIS-style calls all use retries=2 — the genuine retry inconsistency is Socrata-primary 2 / fallback 1 / legislators 1 / POI 1, worth one comment line where they're set.

**R9 — One declarative polygon-layer factory.** The load → `findFeatureContaining` → `findPropCI` → `renderFieldList` pattern appears 12× (grep-verified call sites), 9 as standalone `registerLayer` blocks, ~250 near-duplicate lines. Three factories already exist (`registerSchoolZone`, `registerCpsNetwork`, `registerIlgaChamber`) proving the shape works; a generalized `registerPolygonLayer({loader, style, fields:[{label, props, optional}], enrich, pointOfInterest})` collapses most of the remaining nine. Do this *after* the quick wins land — it touches every module and deserves the R4 smoke test as a net.

**R10 — Repo/deploy hygiene.**
- Pages deploys the whole branch (classic CNAME-file deploy, no `.nojekyll`, no Pages workflow): scrapers, docs, and 4.6 MB of `data/` ship to the CDN. After P0, `data/app/` *must* deploy — but `data/source/raw/` (2.1 MB of zips/xlsx) still needn't. An actions-based Pages deploy that uploads only the app files (+ `.nojekyll` to skip the Jekyll pass) is ~20 lines.
- Bot branches are unique per run (`bot/ilga-roster-update-${run_id}`): an unmerged roster PR spawns a duplicate every week. Fixed branch name + force-push + `gh pr list` guard.
- Scraper deps float (`pip install requests beautifulsoup4`, `python-version: "3.x"`): heuristic HTML parsers are exactly the code that breaks on silent dependency drift. Pin via `scripts/requirements.txt` + `cache: pip`.
- `CPD_DISTRICT_INFO` is still the 32-byte placeholder — the CPD rewrite path has never run against real data in production; treat its first live PR with extra care (or land R3 first). **Root cause now identified — see R11.**

**R11 — The CPD scraper is blocked by Cloudflare's bot challenge; that is *why* the roster has never populated.**
Running `cpd_district_scraper.py` returns **HTTP 403 with `cf-mitigated: challenge`** on the district-finder page (`server: cloudflare`, `cf-ray` present) — a JavaScript/managed challenge, confirmed unchanged against a full real-browser header set (UA + `sec-ch-ua*` + `Sec-Fetch-*` + `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`). The `requests`-based fetcher can't execute the challenge's JS, so `get_district_pages` raises and the whole run exits non-zero at step 1. This is the mechanism behind R10's last bullet: the weekly `update-cpd-roster` job fails at the scrape every time, so `data/app/cpd-district-info.json` stays the `{}` placeholder. The other two scrapers (ilga.gov, congress-legislators — plain HTML / static JSON, no Cloudflare) are unaffected and were validated green (see the 2026-07-09 run above).
- *Safety net already holds — this is a completeness gap, not a correctness risk.* `build_cpd_roster.py`'s `MIN_DISTRICTS=20` input guard plus `validate_index.py`'s `cpd-district-info.json: 0` floor mean a blocked or partial scrape can never overwrite good data with holes; with the file empty, the Police District card degrades to "district number + official link," which is the project's intended honest failure.
- *Partial recovery SHIPPED — station address + phone no longer depend on the scrape.* A review of CPD's ArcGIS org (`services2.arcgis.com/t3tlzCPfmaQzSWAk`) found two CORS-enabled (`access-control-allow-origin: *`) FeatureServers covering part of the roster: `Police_District_Stations_View` (all 22 districts: `DISTRICT`/`NAME`/`ADDRESS`/`PHONE`) and `Police_District_Boundary_View` (the geometry the app already draws). A full sweep of the org's ~55 services confirmed **commander name/status/bio and CAPS phone/email exist nowhere** in it — those remain scrape-only. The Police District card now joins the already-loaded `Police_District_Stations_View` by district number and falls back to its `ADDRESS`/`PHONE` when the roster lacks them, so a click on any district shows real station address + main phone **even while the commander scrape is blocked**. The scraped roster still wins when present. This also fixed a latent join bug: the query keyed the roster on the raw zero-padded `DISTRICT` (`"008"`) instead of the bare integer (`"8"`) the roster uses — now routed through `extractDistrictNumber`. Verified against live ArcGIS data for three known points (Loop→D1, Wrigleyville→D19, Hyde Park→D2) with an empty roster, plus roster-precedence; `validate_index.py` green. The `districtMapUrl` field is effectively superseded by the boundary geometry the app renders; only commander + CAPS contact still need the scrape.
- *Commander/CAPS scrape fix SHIPPED — `cpd_district_scraper.py` now fetches through a real browser.* Added an `--engine {auto,requests,playwright}` switch: `playwright` drives a headless Chromium that executes Cloudflare's managed-challenge JS and reads the resulting rendered HTML (no evasion — a genuine browser), handing identical markup to the unchanged `parse_district_page`; `requests` is the fast browserless path; `auto` (default) tries `requests` and transparently falls back to `playwright` the instant the finder page is blocked (403 / challenge interstitial), so the weekly job works whether or not the runner's IP is challenged. Both engines share a `_looks_like_challenge` detector. The `update-cpd-roster` workflow now installs Chromium (`python3 -m playwright install --with-deps chromium`). Also landed alongside: R3's output guard (`build_cpd_roster.py` refuses a roster with `< MIN_COMMANDERS = 15` non-null commander names — a page reword that nulls the headline field can't silently ship) and R10's dep pinning (`scripts/requirements.txt`, `requests==2.33.1`/`beautifulsoup4==4.15.0`/`playwright==1.61.0`; the ILGA job pins via `pip -c` constraints without pulling Playwright).
  - *Verification:* the real Cloudflare site can't be reached from this sandbox (browser egress is proxy-blocked, same limitation noted throughout), so the challenge-clearing itself is validated against a **faithful local simulation** — a finder page that is a challenge interstitial to a non-JS client but whose JS rewrites the DOM to the real district links once executed (what a managed challenge does after it clears). Results: `requests`/`playwright`/`auto` produce **byte-identical records** on normal fixtures (engine parity); `requests`-only is correctly blocked by the JS-challenge finder while `auto` falls back to Playwright, clears it, and scrapes both districts; `build_cpd_roster.py` passes 22 commanders and refuses 10; the populated roster (bare-integer keys, matching the app's join) flows through `validate_index.py` green. What remains unproven is only whether CPD's *specific* Turnstile config auto-clears for a headless browser on a CI IP — if it turns out to need interactive mode, the honest fallback is to surface the weekly job as a **tracked failure/alert** rather than a silent red run, with the app's station-view address/phone fallback + graceful-degradation card already covering the gap.
  - *Live CI run (`update-cpd-roster`, workflow_dispatch, 2026-07-09):* answered the open question — **Turnstile auto-cleared for headless Chromium on GitHub's IP.** `requests` was 403'd on the finder (the runner IP *is* challenged), `auto` fell back to Playwright, and the browser fetched the finder page **and** a real district page. The guard then correctly refused the result — because the rendered finder yielded only **1** district link (district 11), not 22: the full list is lazy-loaded / behind a JS map widget, something only the live site reveals. Second CI run localized the real obstacle: the finder is an **address-search widget** that renders only one example link (district 11), and per-district pages carry **no** all-districts nav — so link-following discovery tops out at 1. Fix (shipped): discovery now uses CPD's **WordPress sitemap** as the district directory. `robots.txt` (served without a challenge) points at `/wp-sitemap.xml`; `get_district_pages` fetches the sitemap index, walks its child sitemaps, and harvests every `/Nth-district-slug/` `<loc>` — the canonical list of all 22 pages. The finder is still fetched first (cheap, and its Playwright navigation warms the `cf_clearance` cookie), but the sitemap is the source of truth. The `auto`-fallback decision was moved to a dedicated one-shot `requests` probe of the finder (discovery now swallows a blocked finder and leans on the sitemap, so it can no longer double as the block signal). Verified locally against sitemap fixtures: **both engines discover 22/22**, and the district URLs survive Chromium's XML-viewer rendering of the fetched sitemap. Third CI run confirmed the sitemap path finds all 22 live districts and fetches them — but surfaced a last parser gap: the live pages carry the commander name **inline** in the heading (`Meet your commander – Sheamus Mannion`, en-dash separated), whereas `parse_commander` expected the name in a *following* block, so it matched 1/22. Fixed: `parse_commander` now extracts the name after the dash in the heading (en/em-dash or hyphen), keeping the old trailing-block form as a fallback; guarded against prose-after-dash. Added a per-field coverage summary to the scrape (makes future parser drift obvious in one log line) and a `parse_commander` regression test covering both layouts + suffixes/initials/acting.
  - **RESOLVED — the pipeline works end-to-end against the live site (CI, 2026-07-09).** The confirmation run scraped all 22 districts, `build_cpd_roster.py` passed the guards, and `validate_index.py` passed with the populated roster — every district resolved a real commander (e.g. D1 Sheamus Mannion, D2 Herbert Williams III, D18 correctly flagged `acting_commander`), bio, station address, CAPS email, district-map URL, and source URL. `data/app/cpd-district-info.json` went from the 32-byte `{}` placeholder to a full 22-district roster. So: Turnstile clears headless on GitHub IPs, sitemap discovery finds all 22, and parsing works. Two residual notes, neither a blocker: (a) `mainPhone`/`capsPhone` come through null (the live pages no longer expose `tel:` links in the parsed block) — `mainPhone` is already covered by the app's ArcGIS station-view fallback; `capsPhone` is an honest null. (b) The workflow's final `gh pr create` step fails with *"GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests"* — a **repo setting**, not a code issue: enable Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" (this gates all three roster workflows). The bot branch is still pushed with the data, so a human can open the PR until the setting is flipped.

**Architecture verdict:** the layer-registry contract is right and survives all of the above unchanged. The single-page philosophy also survives — what changes is that *generated data* stops living inside hand-maintained source. Resist adding a build step or framework; after P0 the "build" is still just "run a Python script when data changes, commit the JSON."

## 5. Quick Wins (exact before/after)

### QW1 — Simplify the school-board blob: −892 KB raw, −316 KB gzipped, one regenerated line ✅ SHIPPED

*Shipped in this PR via `scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py` (topology-aware mapshaper, not the per-ring approach sketched below — per-ring DP created a district overlap). Actual result: blob 975,796 → 83,470 B; `index.html` 1,301,984 → 409,712 B raw / 112,216 B gzip. The before/after shape is unchanged; only the numbers below are updated.*

`index.html:2553` today (975,796 bytes on one line; head shown):

```js
  var SCHOOL_BOARD_DISTRICTS_GEOJSON = JSON.parse('{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":...   // 24,904 coord pairs, 14-15 decimals
```

After (83,470 bytes — same variable, schema, and district properties; geometry topology-simplified like its two sibling layers):

```js
  var SCHOOL_BOARD_DISTRICTS_GEOJSON = JSON.parse('{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":...   // 3,525 coord pairs, 6 decimals
```

Measured: `index.html` 1,301,984 → 409,712 B (gzip 427,836 → 112,216). Validated with the app's own `pointInGeometry`/`findFeatureContaining`: 2000/2000 on the repo's protocol, 0 topology breaks, 0 internal wrong-district misses, 20/20 district interiors correct. Generated by the committed `scripts/build_embedded_boundaries.py` (which validates before it rewrites the line and refuses on failure), not by hand; provenance comment updated. This wins even if you do the externalization (P0) later — it's the same bytes, just in a fetched file.

### QW2 — sw.js: network-first shell (returning visitors currently always see last deploy's rosters)

`sw.js:52-61` before:

```js
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then((cached) => {
      const network = fetch(event.request)
        .then((response) => {
          if (response.ok) {
            const clone = response.clone();
            caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => cache.put(event.request, clone));
          }
          return response;
        })
        .catch(() => cached);
      return cached || network;
    })
  );
```

After (network-first with cache fallback — online visits are always current, offline still boots):

```js
  event.respondWith(
    fetch(event.request)
      .then((response) => {
        if (response.ok) {
          const clone = response.clone();
          caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then((cache) => cache.put(event.request, clone));
        }
        return response;
      })
      .catch(() => caches.match(event.request))
  );
```

The header comment's own rule ("staleness there is unacceptable") currently loses to `return cached || network` — the rosters live inside the cached shell. Online performance cost is one conditional request (GitHub Pages answers 304 + headers when unchanged).

### QW3 — 44 ms of `node --check` between "bot rewrote 1.3 MB of source" and "PR opened"

Both workflows, after the "Rebuild embedded roster" step and before "Check for changes" (`update-ilga-roster.yml:37` / `update-cpd-roster.yml:37`):

```yaml
      - name: Validate rewritten index.html still parses
        run: |
          python3 - <<'EOF'
          import re, subprocess, sys
          html = open("index.html").read()
          scripts = re.findall(r"<script>(.*?)</script>", html, re.DOTALL)
          assert scripts, "no inline scripts found"
          open("/tmp/inline.js", "w").write(max(scripts, key=len))
          subprocess.run(["node", "--check", "/tmp/inline.js"], check=True)
          assert html.count("registerLayer(") >= 15, "layer registrations went missing"
          EOF
```

This is the floor, not the ceiling (see matrix #5 for the real smoke test). Division of labor, verified empirically: `node --check` catches syntax death from a malformed splice but **not** the module-deletion overmatch — the over-matched output still parses — which is exactly what the `registerLayer(` count assertion (15 occurrences today: 1 definition + 11 direct calls + 3 factory bodies) is there to catch. Measured: 44 ms.

### QW4 — Ask TIGERweb for 11 cm coordinates instead of sub-nanometer ones

`index.html:2117-2118` before:

```js
    var url = "https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb/Legislative/MapServer/" +
      layerIndex + "/query?where=" + where + "&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=geojson";
```

After:

```js
    var url = "https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb/Legislative/MapServer/" +
      layerIndex + "/query?where=" + where + "&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=geojson&geometryPrecision=6";
```

~40% smaller payloads on the three heaviest network layers (coordinate digits beyond 6dp measure 41.5% of GeoJSON bytes); zero visual or classification difference at any zoom this map allows (maxZoom 18 ≈ 0.6 m/px). Apply the same parameter to `loadArcGISGeoJSON` (line 1607) and `loadCookCountyLayerGeoJSON` (2710-2711).

### QW5 — Warm the connections the first paint actually waits on

`index.html:13-14` before:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
```

After:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://a.basemaps.cartocdn.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://b.basemaps.cartocdn.com">
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://data.cityofchicago.org">
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org">
```

Tiles are requested the moment the inline script runs, from four sharded hosts that today get no warm-up (grep: fonts are the only resource hints in the file). Preconnecting two shards covers the initial viewport's parallelism; dns-prefetch on the click-time APIs is nearly free.

### Bonus one-liner — the geocoder's Enter-key double request

`index.html:1003-1005`: the submit handler never cancels the pending input-debounce timer, so pressing Enter within 550 ms of the last keystroke fires the search, then the debounce aborts it and re-issues an identical request (~550 ms + 1 RTT of added latency on the fast-typist path). Add `clearTimeout(debounceTimer);` as the first line of the submit handler — mirroring the guard the result-click handler already has at line 992.
