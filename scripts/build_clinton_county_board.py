Resolve scripts/clinton_county_board_scraper.py's raw output into
data/app/clinton-county-board-members.json, keyed by Clinton County Board
district (5 districts of 3 members each).

index.html's consolidated county-board layer fetches this file lazily on first
click and joins it to data/app/clinton-county-board-districts.json by district
number.

THE ROSTER IS THE PAGE AND THE GEOMETRY IS THE RETURNS. Clinton's districts are
derived from its certified per-precinct returns because the county publishes its
board map only as a PDF (build_clinton_boundaries.py); its members come from the
county's own board page, which is the richest source this route has met — name,
phone, e-mail and term-expiry year on all fifteen, with the Board Chairman and
Vice Chairman named above the grid.

THE DRIFT CHECK. The scraper re-reads the county's live precinct count and each
numbered board contest's precinct count from the Clerk's results system every
week, and this asserts both against the shipped dissolve. It COUNTS rather than
names — two requests instead of thirty-four — and both events that would
invalidate the boundary (a re-precincting or a redistricting) move the counts.

WHAT SHIPS: name, district, phone, e-mail, term-expiry year, and the Chair and
Vice-Chair roles the county itself prints. WHAT DOES NOT: party, which the page
does not publish.
