Build data/app/township-officials.json — the township card's officeholder
roster — keyed by the 10-digit Census county-subdivision GEOID the app's
township layer already carries on every TIGERweb feature, so the runtime
join needs no name normalization (the municipal-officials pattern exactly).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Township officers were a RECORDED CANDIDATE, not a new
idea: EXPANSION_GUIDE Appendix A carried "officer candidate via clerk
yearbooks" on the township row, Pattern A (§1.4) named the concept, and a
dozen municipal scrapers deliberately bound their county's township section
OUT "so a future township scrape is additive". This is that scrape's first
county. Cook launches it because its source is the cleanest in the fleet:
the County Clerk's directory API publishes every township's governing
officials as structured JSON under the TWNSP jurisdiction type — the same
feed cook_municipal_officials_scraper.py already reads for the Town of
Cicero — and the whole feed was privacy-audited before this builder existed
(2026-08-19: zero home addresses, zero personal e-mails on any governing
record; see the exclusion block below for where the hazards actually live).

THE JOIN. Census 2020 county-subdivision GEOID = 17 + county FIPS + COUSUBFP,
resolved from the committed reference data/source/st17_il_cousub2020.txt
(the Illinois rows of the Census national_cousub2020.txt codes file — the
cousub sibling of st17_il_place_by_county2020.txt). Township rows are
CLASSFP T1/T5; the C5 city-type cousubs (Chicago, Evanston) and the Z9
undefined-water filler are not townships and never match. The Clerk's
"<Base> Township" strips to a folded base name that matched all 29 live
townships exactly on first measurement; anything unresolved is FATAL, never
guessed.

WHAT NEVER SHIPS, and why each exclusion exists:
  - Democratic/Republican Township Committeeperson: PARTY offices, out of
    scope by the governance taxonomy (§1.6) — and the one place this API
    carries personal contact (gmail/yahoo/aol in Addresses[0].Email on 31 of
    57 records, home-address SLOT AddressTypeId 1 — empty today, dropped
    unconditionally in case it ever populates).
  - Library Trustee: another body's board; Cicero's ships on the
    library-district card via build_cicero_library_trustees.py.
  - Per-person phone/e-mail: the feed publishes ONE shared hall mailbox and
    hall line per township — often a named staffer's mailbox, not the
    officeholder's — so contact ships on the township's office block, never
    on a person row, where it would be wrong attribution.
  - Any address that is not the township hall: every governing record's
    single address carries AddressTypeId 3 (the hall) today, and this
    builder REFUSES any other type, so a residence can never ride this file
    (the build_cicero_library_trustees.py posture).

EVANSTON is the feed's one non-township: its township government dissolved
into the city in 2014, TIGER 2020 carries no township polygon for it, and
its only TWNSP records are the two party committeepersons. After the
exclusions it holds zero governing records and is skipped BY NAME
(EXPECTED_OFFICELESS); any other township going officeless is FATAL — the
Sangamon lesson, a guard keyed on requests succeeding is blind to a feed
that succeeds at nothing.

CICERO ships here TOO, on purpose. The Town of Cicero and Cicero Township
are one consolidated government (Census FUNCSTAT C); the Clerk answers
"Cicero Township" with that government's officials, so both containment
questions — "what municipality am I in" and "what township am I in" — get
the county's own answer. The municipality card keys it 1714351 (place), this
file keys it 1703114364 (cousub); the President is the head on both.

Usage:
    python3 build_township_officials.py <cook-scraper-output.json> [...] [--out-dir DIR]

Multiple payloads are accepted for the county-by-county growth the
municipal roster proved out; each must carry `county` and a raw
`township_officials` list (the Clerk-API record shape).
