"""
Resolve scripts/kane_county_board_scraper.py's raw output into
data/app/kane-county-board-members.json, keyed by Kane County Board district
("1".."24" — 24 single-member districts) plus a top-level "chair" for the
countywide-elected Board Chair (the DuPage/McHenry roster shape).

index.html's consolidated county-board layer fetches this file lazily on
first click (same-origin) and joins it to the county's own
KaneCo_IL_County_Board boundary GIS by district number. The GIS keeps
carrying the sitting member's NAME (used for hover and as the card's
fallback); this roster enriches the card with party, the official office
phone, email, and a profile link. Stage 2 of the two-stage pipeline (see
scripts/kane_county_board_scraper.py); mirrors
build_mchenry_county_board_roster.py.

Usage:
    python3 build_kane_county_board_roster.py <raw-scraper-output.json> [output_dir]

output_dir defaults to the repo's data/app/ directory.
