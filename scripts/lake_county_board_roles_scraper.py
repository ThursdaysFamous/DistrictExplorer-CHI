"""
Scrape the Lake County Board leadership roles (Chair / Vice-Chair) from the
county's own Board Members directory.

Why this scraper is ROLES-ONLY: Lake is the county whose boundary GIS
carries the officeholder data itself — member name, official phone/email,
and district page ride the LakeCounty_PoliticalBoundaries features, which
the county edits frequently (fresher than any weekly scrape could be), so
the card reads those live. The one officeholder fact the GIS does NOT
carry is board leadership: the directory page tags one member "Board
Chair" and one "Board Vice-Chair" (elected from among the 19 members —
unlike DuPage/Kane/McHenry, Lake's chair is not a separate countywide
office). This scraper captures exactly that, keyed by district, with every
member's name included so the builder can verify a full parse and the card
can refuse a stale role: index.html applies a role ONLY when the scraped
surname matches the GIS member name for that district, so a
reorganization the scrape hasn't caught yet degrades to role-less rows,
never a mislabeled chair.

Stage 2 is scripts/build_lake_county_board_roles.py ->
data/app/lake-county-board-roles.json.

Source page (Granicus/CivicPlus):
  https://www.lakecountyil.gov/2336/Board-Members
  -> per-district blocks reading "District N: NAME" + "Board Chair" /
     "Board Vice-Chair" / "Board Member". Parsed from the page text (the
     CMS markup carries no stable classes), with count guards downstream.

Fetch engines (`--engine auto`): the site's edge 403s this project's
datacenter egress, so the ladder is `requests` first, then `wayback` (the
Internet Archive crawls Lake's site fine — recent snapshots exist — and
the newest snapshot is refused if older than WAYBACK_MAX_AGE_DAYS).
No Playwright rung: a single-page, secondary enrichment doesn't warrant a
browser install, and an edge 403 of this class doesn't clear for headless
Chromium anyway (verified on the Kendall/McHenry siblings).
