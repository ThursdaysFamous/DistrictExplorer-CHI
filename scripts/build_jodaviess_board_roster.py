Resolve scripts/jodaviess_county_board_scraper.py's raw output into
data/app/jo-daviess-county-board-members.json, keyed by Jo Daviess County
Board district ("1".."17" — seventeen SINGLE-member districts, the widest
single-member board in the fleet after Peoria's 18).

index.html's consolidated county-board layer fetches this file lazily on first
click (same-origin) and joins it by district number to
data/app/jo-daviess-county-board-districts.json — the county's OWN shapefile,
purchased under GIS data licence #008382 and displayed with the county's
written permission (build_jodaviess_board_districts.py has the whole story).
Both halves come from the county itself: no derivation, no tracing, no guess.

Shape mirrors the other rosters — {district: {members: [...], sourceUrl}} —
with the Livingston/Lee vacancy posture: a seat the county prints as VACANT
ships as `vacancies: 1` on its district entry, COUNTED, NEVER NAMED, because
dropping the row would misstate the board's size and naming it would invent an
officeholder. The count guard therefore counts SEATS (named + vacant), which
must equal exactly 17 with districts 1..17 each appearing exactly once — the
same rule that keeps a parse regression distinguishable from a resignation,
and, because the district set is asserted against the boundary module's
EXPECTED_DISTRICTS, the weekly run also fails the day the county's page stops
describing seventeen districts (the earliest visible sign of a
reapportionment; the purchased boundary would then need re-licensing —
see build_jodaviess_board_districts.py).

FLOORS, set at what the page actually publishes (2026-08-17): every named
member carries a party letter (16/16 — a member without one is a parse break,
so the floor is exact); 15+ carry a term; e-mail and phone floors sit two
under the published 16/16 so a single member dropping a listing reads as the
county's change rather than a red week, while a mass loss (the Brown
Cloudflare failure) still trips both this and check_roster_retention.py.

TERM STRINGS ARE NORMALISED IN FORMAT ONLY: the county prints "Term: 2024 to
2028" on most rows and "Term 2022-2026" on one; both ship as "YYYY to YYYY".
The years are never touched. Roles are normalised to the fleet's labels
("Chair" -> "Board Chair", "Vice-Chair" -> "Vice Chair") so one reader renders
every county's board the same way.
