"""Generate docs/PRESS_LIST.md from docs/press-list.json.

Same convention as build_county_status.py: the JSON is the data, the markdown is a READING of
it, and the markdown is never hand-edited. `--check` fails if the two have drifted.

Why this is generated rather than written: a press list is a pile of facts that go stale
independently — an address is retired, a weekly changes hands, a desk is folded into another.
Hand-keeping the prose and the data in agreement is exactly the drift this repo generates files
to prevent. Re-verify with scripts/verify_press_list.py, which re-fetches every cited page.
