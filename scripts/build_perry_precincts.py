"""Build Perry County's twenty-seven voting precincts from Census 2020 voting districts.

WHY THIS COUNTY WAS DARK, AND WHAT OPENED IT. Perry's recorded blocker is its
website: the county's site refuses this client, so nothing it publishes about
itself could be read. That blocker is unchanged and this build does not touch it.
What changed is that the county's ELECTION AUTHORITY publishes somewhere else —
results.gbsvote.com, which carries THIRTEEN Illinois counties (plus one in
Indiana) — and a county's certified canvass answers both questions a join needs
without the county's own site being reachable at all.

THE VENDOR WAS NOT A NEW DISCOVERY AND SHOULD NOT BE READ AS ONE. This project
recorded it in its own backlog on 2026-08-20, swept it county by county, and
measured this county's board form from it that day. What did not happen for the
day after is the rest: the finding never reached the county's gap record, never reached
CLAUDE.md's list of results platforms, and never became a build. A measurement
filed in a backlog and nowhere else is a measurement the next pass repeats.

THE BOARD'S FORM IS SETTLED, AND IT IS AT LARGE. Perry's certified 2026 General
Primary carries a single "FOR COUNTY COMMISSIONER" contest per party, each
reporting 27 of 27 precincts — the same 27-of-27 every countywide office on that
ballot reports (County Clerk and Recorder, County Treasurer, Sheriff, Treasurer).
There is no district-suffixed board contest anywhere in it, and the contests that
report 1 of 1 are the twenty-seven precinct committeeperson races, which is the
expected shape and the check that the reporting counts mean what they appear to.
So Perry is a COMMISSION county electing county-wide: THERE IS NO BOARD GEOMETRY
TO SEEK and none should be invented. Its commissioners are not carried here
either — that is a roster, it belongs on the County card with a source and a date,
and the only county source for it is the site this client cannot read.

THE PRECINCTS ARE THE CENSUS FABRIC, ONE FOR ONE. THE JASPER TEST PASSES 27/27:
the census voting districts carry Perry's twenty-seven precinct names exactly, and
their POP100 sums to the county's own 2020 population of 20,945 to the person. No
dissolve is needed and none is performed — each precinct IS one voting district.

ONE SPELLING IS RECORDED RATHER THAN CHOSEN BETWEEN. The county's results feed
writes its county-seat precincts closed up, DUQUOIN 1 through DUQUOIN 12, where
the census writes DU QUOIN 1 through DU QUOIN 12 — two words, which is how the
city itself spells its name. That is a rendering difference and not a different
precinct, and it is exactly what the shared module's norm() exists to absorb: case,
punctuation and spacing differ freely between a county's results feed and a census
BASENAME. So COUNTY_PRECINCTS below carries the county's rendering, because that is
what the county published and what the Jasper test must match, while each shipped
feature is LABELLED from the census basename, because "Du Quoin" is the place's
name and "Duquoin" would be this project inventing a spelling nobody uses. Both
renderings are therefore in this file's provenance and neither is silently
preferred.

NO POLLING PLACE SHIPS. That belongs with a roster guard and a date rather than
inside a geometry file — the rule Calhoun's build set — and in this county it is
not readable anyway.

THIS IS A RARE OPERATOR STEP (requests + shapely). Re-run only if Perry
re-precincts or TIGERweb republishes the voting-district fabric. Output is
deterministic, so --check is a byte compare.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/build_perry_precincts.py            # write
    python3 scripts/build_perry_precincts.py --check    # verify shipped == fresh
