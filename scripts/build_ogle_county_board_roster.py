Resolve scripts/ogle_county_board_scraper.py's raw output into
data/app/ogle-county-board-members.json, keyed by Ogle County Board district
("1".."8" — eight districts electing three members each, 24 seats).

index.html's consolidated county-board layer fetches this file lazily on first
click (same-origin) and joins it by district number to
data/app/ogle-county-board-districts.json, the precinct dissolve built by
build_ogle_board_districts.py from the county's adopted reapportionment
resolution. Ogle is the fleet's second county where BOTH halves are DERIVED
rather than fetched — after Livingston, and for the same reason: the county
publishes officeholders and a written composition but no district geometry.

Shape mirrors the McHenry/Kendall/Livingston/DeKalb rosters —
{district: {members: [...], sourceUrl}}. The Board Chair and Vice Chair are
district members carrying a `role`, not a countywide section: Ogle's board
elects its officers from among its own 24 members, so there is no at-large seat
to imply. (The Chair currently sits in District 5 and the Vice Chair in
District 2 — they are not fixed to a district, which is exactly why the role
travels with the member rather than with the card.)

# THE SEAT COUNT IS CARRIED INTO THE DATA, not just asserted in this docstring,
# because the card has no other way to know a district is SHORT. The floors
# below are deliberately permissive — a resignation between scrapes must not
# block a refresh — and that permissiveness had a silent side: the district
# keeps its key, one row simply stops appearing, and the card shows a smaller
# delegation than the county elects with nothing saying so. Emitting `seats`
# lets the card say "1 of 3 seats not listed in the county's directory"
# instead. It states what the source shows, never why: a row can be missing
# because a seat is empty or because the parse dropped it, and this county
# publishes nothing that tells the two apart (the Sangamon members-index
# distinction does not exist here). Making the shortfall VISIBLE is what avoids
# the false trade between a silently short card and a floor tightened to an
# equality, which would freeze the file with a departed member still named.
