"""Addresses this repo publishes nowhere, because mail to them cannot arrive.

WHY THIS IS SHARED RATHER THAN PER-BUILDER. build_county_clerk_roster.py has
carried a KNOWN_UNDELIVERABLE list since 2026-07-31, when a letter to White
County's published clerk address hard-bounced after five days — the card had
been telling a reader "write to your clerk here" while nothing they sent could
arrive. That is the honesty rule failing quietly, and it turned out not to be
one county's problem: an MX sweep of every shipped address on 2026-09-04 (3,336
addresses, 768 domains, 0 network skips, every finding confirmed on a second
independent resolver) found nineteen more across three instances.

WHAT A FINDING HERE IS, EXACTLY. The domain does not resolve at all — no MX, no
A, no AAAA, NXDOMAIN. That is the only DNS evidence strong enough to withhold
on. A domain that resolves but publishes no MX has an IMPLICIT MX at its A
record (RFC 5321 §5.1) and is NOT here; validate_card_links.py reports those
separately as unverified, because only sending settles them.

THE CORRECTION IS NEVER APPLIED. Every one of these is one character from a
domain that does resolve — warrecountyil.gov/warrencountyil.gov,
yahoo.ocm/yahoo.com — and the obvious fix was measured live for all of them.
That is evidence for the DIAGNOSIS and nothing more. Douglas County settled
this in Illinois: its yearbook printed `douglascountuil.gov` and the builder
dropped the address rather than "silently correcting a character in someone's
contact detail". Officeholder data is never guessed, and a contact detail is
officeholder data.

WHAT STILL SHIPS. Only the address is withheld. The name, office, phone, party
and page URL are untouched, so every contact route that works survives and the
card simply stops offering one that does not. No app change is needed — each
card renders its e-mail row only when the field is present.

WHAT DOES NOT BELONG HERE: A CORRECT ADDRESS WHOSE ROUTE IS BROKEN. Every
entry below is a MISTYPED ADDRESS, and that is what makes the list safe — the
moment a source publishes the right one the entry stops matching and says so.
A correct address on a domain whose MX host does not resolve is a different
thing: the county can fix its DNS tomorrow without the address changing by a
character, so an entry here would never retire and would go on withholding a
working contact. Those are REPORTED by validate_card_links.py and left to the
monthly issue — `auditor@harrisoncountyia.org` is one today (its MX names
mail.harrisoncountyia.org, which is NXDOMAIN on both resolvers).

RETIRING AN ENTRY, AND WHY THE AUDIT IS A GATE RATHER THAN A PRINTED LINE.
The first version of this module printed a RETIRE line from the builders and
returned a list every caller discarded, so an entry that had outlived its
reason was a permanent silent hole — the exact state check_roster_retention.py
records having had to fix in ACCEPTED_DROPS. Worse, it could not have been
trusted anyway: the "addresses seen" set was process-global, so a builder that
skipped a county on a count guard printed a RETIRE for that county's entry
having simply never looked at it.

So the audit is `--check`, it reads the SHIPPED TREE rather than one run's
memory, and it FAILS:

  * an entry naming a data/app file that no instance has  -> orphaned
  * an entry whose address is in the shipped tree anyway  -> the withhold
    stopped firing, which is the failure this list exists to prevent

The third test needs DNS and lives in validate_card_links.py's monthly mail
section: a listed domain that has come BACK — resolving, with a live mail
route — is reported so the entry can be retired. That is the same inversion
EXPECTED_UNREACHABLE already uses, where becoming reachable is the finding.

If an address is ever reported working rather than re-addressed, verify by
SENDING — never by assuming, which is the limit the White County bounce
recorded from the other direction: its DNS was healthy the whole time.
