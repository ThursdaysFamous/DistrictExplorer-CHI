Resolve scripts/franklin_county_board_scraper.py's raw output into
data/app/franklin-county-board-members.json, keyed by Franklin County Board
district (3 districts of 3 members each, staggered).

index.html's consolidated county-board layer fetches this file lazily on first
click and joins it to data/app/franklin-county-board-districts.json by district
number.

THE ROSTER IS THE PAGE AND THE GEOMETRY IS THE RETURNS. Franklin's districts
are derived from its certified per-precinct returns because the county
publishes no boundary as data (build_franklin_boundaries.py); its members come
from the county's own page, because a canvass shows who WON a completed term
and cannot show a seat filled since — the split Edgar's District 6 made the
case for.

THE DRIFT CHECK, which is what makes a derived boundary safe to ship. The
scraper re-reads two facts from the Clerk's results system every week: the
county's live precinct count, and the precinct count of each numbered board
contest in the newest board election. This asserts both against the shipped
dissolve and FAILS on any disagreement. It is deliberately weaker than a
full per-precinct re-read — it counts rather than names — and says so: it
catches a re-precincting or a redistricting, which are the two events that
would invalidate the boundary, and it costs two requests instead of thirty-five.

WHAT SHIPS: name, district, the role the county prints beside the member, phone
and e-mail. WHAT DOES NOT: the Address column, which is every member's HOME
address (the Madison/Peoria rule, enforced in the scraper by discarding the
column and asserted again here), and party, which the members page does not
publish.

THE CHAIR IS THE COUNTY'S OWN LABEL, not an inference from the canvasses.
§3.5.1 warns against badging a chair derived from returns, because a
chairmanship is elected from within the body and no certified document shows
it. This is the other case: the county's members page prints a role beside four
of its nine members, and the table distinguishes the board's own officers
("Chairman", "Vice Chairman") from committee chairs by naming the committee in
the latter. Both ship exactly as printed.
