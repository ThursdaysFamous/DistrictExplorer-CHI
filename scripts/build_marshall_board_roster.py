Resolve scripts/marshall_county_board_scraper.py's raw output into
data/app/marshall-county-board-members.json, keyed by board district.

Marshall seats twelve members across three districts, four each, on staggered
terms — half the board expires in 2026 and half in 2028 — so the term year is
per-seat ballot information and is carried through (the Boone posture). The
county marks one Chairperson and one Vice-Chairperson by name in the table;
both are rendered as their own rows carry them, and nothing is inferred.

THE COMPOSITION CROSS-CHECK — the PDF this roster comes from is also the
authority for the district BOUNDARIES, which are Census townships dissolved per
the DISTRICT #n headings (scripts/build_marshall_board_districts.py). This
builder re-reads what the scraper saw and fails on any difference, so a
redistricting turns the weekly job red instead of leaving the derived lines a
cycle out of date.

Marshall is the cleanest fit for that check the fleet has: composition and
roster are the SAME TABLE in the SAME document, so the county cannot publish a
new roster under new districts without the check seeing both at once. (Cass, by
contrast, links its composition from a separate PDF and can only get a
seat-count tripwire.)

WHITESPACE IS NOT A NAME DIFFERENCE — the comparison is on the same
punctuation-insensitive key the boundary builder dissolves on, because the
county writes "LaPrairie" where TIGER writes "La Prairie". Re-spacing a
township name is not a redistricting and must not fail the weekly job.
