"""
Resolve scripts/washington_county_board_scraper.py's raw output into
data/app/washington-county-board-members.json, keyed by board district.

Washington seats fifteen members across three districts, five each. The county
marks no chair on this page, so none is rendered (the Woodford/Henry posture) —
the card links the board page instead of guessing.

THE COMPOSITION CROSS-CHECK — the same page this roster comes from is also the
authority for the district BOUNDARIES, which are Census townships dissolved per
its parentheticals (scripts/build_washington_board_districts.py). This builder
re-reads what the scraper saw and fails on any difference, so a redistricting
turns the weekly job red instead of leaving the derived lines a cycle out of
date. Same mechanism as De Witt; here it is simpler, because Washington's
districts are whole townships with no numbering to reconcile.

DOMAIN SANITY WARNING — the county publishes one member's address on
"washingtonco.illnois.gov", a misspelling of the domain its five siblings use.
It ships AS PUBLISHED: correcting an officeholder's contact details is not this
pipeline's call, even when the correction looks obvious. The builder WARNS
instead, so the typo is in front of a human on every weekly PR.
