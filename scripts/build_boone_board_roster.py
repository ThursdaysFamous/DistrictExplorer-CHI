"""
Resolve scripts/boone_county_board_scraper.py's raw output into
data/app/boone-county-board-members.json, keyed by board district — three
four-member districts, every seat carrying a phone, an e-mail and the
"Term Expires" year the page publishes (Boone's terms are staggered, so the
year answers "which of these do I vote on next?" per seat). Role tags ride
their member rows exactly as the page states them — currently a single
Vice-Chairman; no Chairman is named anywhere on the page, so none is
rendered.

index.html's consolidated county-board layer fetches this file lazily on
first click (same-origin) and joins it by district number to the county
GIS's three pre-dissolved district layers, merged at load time.

Usage:
    python3 build_boone_board_roster.py <raw-scraper-output.json> [output_dir]
