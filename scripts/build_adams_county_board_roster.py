Stage 2 of the Adams County Board roster pipeline: turn the scraper's raw
canvass JSON into data/app/adams-county-board-members.json.

WHAT SHIPS AND WHAT DOES NOT. Adams elects 21 members from 7 districts, three
apiece, on staggered four-year terms — the 2018 general elected TWO per district
under an explicit "(Vote for not more than TWO)", the 2020 primary ONE under
"(Vote for ONE)". So today's board is fourteen members seated in November 2022
and seven seated in November 2024. ONLY THE SEVEN SHIP, because the November
2022 canvass is not published anywhere this project can read: the county's own
results page sits behind the same Akamai deny as its board page, Clarity does
not carry the county, and platinumelectionresults.com — which does carry it,
and is where the seven come from — returns an empty one-page placeholder for
Adams for 2021, 2022 and 2023.

That is a partial roster and the card says so in those words. The alternative
was to keep shipping nothing, which is what this county had: before this
pipeline the card named a district and no person at all. Naming one of a
reader's three board members, with the election that seated them on the row, is
strictly more than naming none — and the shortfall is stated rather than left
for the reader to infer from a short list.

SEATS ARE ASSERTED FROM ISBE'S COUNTY-BOARD STRUCTURE TABLE (21 seats, 7
districts, 3 per district), which this repo already cites for STRUCTURE only —
its metadata is 2007-vintage and it carries no revision date, so it is never
read for people and never for currency. Two independent things agree with it
here: the county's own canvasses carry exactly seven board districts, and the
2018/2024 seat cadence (2 + 1) sums to three per district.

NOTHING IS BADGED CHAIR. ISBE's County Officers Book names Adams's chair, and
this repo's own measurement found that column wrong in 16 of the 56 counties
where a comparison was possible, so it is read nowhere (the Coles rule). A
canvass cannot show who the board later elected as its chair.

NO CONTACT DETAIL PER MEMBER, for the same reason Clark ships none: it exists
only on a page no automated client may read. The board block carries the
county's own courthouse address and the County Clerk's published number,
labelled as the Clerk's — not relabelled as the board's.
