"""
Resolve scripts/mchenry_county_board_scraper.py's raw output into
data/app/mchenry-county-board-members.json, keyed by McHenry County Board
district ("1".."9" — 9 districts electing 2 members each) plus a top-level
"chair" for the countywide-elected Board Chairman (the DuPage roster shape).

index.html's consolidated county-board layer fetches this file lazily on
first click (same-origin) and joins it to the county's own boundary GIS by
district number — the same boundary+roster join the Will, DuPage, and
Kendall entries use. Stage 2 of the two-stage pipeline (see
scripts/mchenry_county_board_scraper.py); mirrors
build_dupage_county_board_roster.py.

Usage:
    python3 build_mchenry_county_board_roster.py <raw-scraper-output.json> [output_dir]

output_dir defaults to the repo's data/app/ directory.
