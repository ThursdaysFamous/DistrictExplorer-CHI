Scrape county board supervisors from the 29 Wisconsin counties that publish a
district-keyed member list a client here can read, plus Milwaukee's and Racine's
own GIS layers and Lafayette's dated capture. Stage 1 of the pair;
build_wi_county_board_roster.py turns the intermediate JSON into
data/app/county-board-members.json.

WHY ONLY TWENTY-NINE OF SEVENTY-TWO
-----------------------------------
Wisconsin publishes county board DISTRICTS statewide (Wis. Stat. 5.15(4)(br)1,
see build_wi_supervisory_districts.py) and publishes the PEOPLE in them
nowhere: each county names its own supervisors, 72 different ways. Twenty-nine
pair a district with a person in a form a parser can read (plus Milwaukee and
Racine off their own GIS layers, below). The rest are not oversights and are
recorded as such:

  * Kenosha and Ozaukee publish district MAPS — a page per district with a PDF
    and no name on it anywhere. They were checked three pages deep apiece.
    This file used to claim 23 counties; that count came from a sweep that
    tested district NUMBERS, and numbers are what a map index has.
  * Marinette publishes 29 of its 30 seats. District 26 is an unnumbered
    "VACANT SEAT" row in an alphabetical list, and assigning it by elimination
    would be an inference the county never wrote, so the county stays out.
  * The rest could not be read: 8 answer 403 to a datacenter client and hold
    it against browser headers (Marathon, La Crosse, Outagamie, Fond du Lac,
    Lincoln, Monroe, Rock, Sheboygan), Taylor sits behind an sgcaptcha
    challenge answering 202 (an access control, not an obstacle to route
    around), Forest does not resolve, and the remainder publish their members
    as PDFs, images or prose with no district column.
  * LAFAYETTE WAS THE NINTH OF THOSE 403s AND IS NOW THE ONE COUNTY CARRIED AS
    A DATED CAPTURE — see DOCUMENT_COUNTIES. Its refusal was re-measured
    2026-08-29 and is real (a Cloudflare managed challenge, bare host and www,
    browser headers), but the record had gone one step further than the
    measurement: the county was filed under "could not be read" when what
    could not be read was its HOST. The page itself publishes all sixteen
    seats in the plainest shape on this list, which the Internet Archive's own
    2025-02-14 capture of it shows and which `_same_line_lead` reads 16/16.

NINE OF THOSE "UNREADABLE" COUNTIES WERE PUBLISHING ALL ALONG (2026-08-27)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dane 37, Shawano 27, Juneau 21, Oneida 21, Richland 21, Kewaunee 20, Rusk 19,
Trempealeau 17 and Price 13 — 196 seats — were recorded here as publishing
nothing readable, and both causes were on this side of the wire.

The re-sweep was provoked by one county: build_wi_supervisory_districts.py's
docstring cites Trempealeau's own board page as the authority for its
seventeen seats, that page was never wired into this scraper, and a cold-ask
e-mail was being drafted to the county for a list it publishes.

  CAUSE ONE, THE READER. `DIST` needs the literal word "district" beside the
  number. A page that says it once in a COLUMN HEADER and then prints bare
  numerals in the cells is invisible to all three original readings — so
  Oneida, Price and Trempealeau were filed under "no district column" when
  having one is exactly why they could not be read. `_column` reads the cell.

  CAUSE TWO, THE SWEEP. It asked each COUNTY's site and never the BOARD's.
  Dane's 37 supervisors are on board.danecounty.gov, a different host from the
  countyofdane.com this project's own clerk file carries. ASK THE BOARD'S OWN
  HOST BEFORE RECORDING THAT A COUNTY PUBLISHES NOTHING.

THE READING DIRECTION IS PINNED PER COUNTY, NOT DETECTED
--------------------------------------------------------
Three page shapes carry the same information:

    same-line   "District #1 - Steve Sandstrom"      (Bayfield)
    before      "Jim Brown" then ": District 1"      (Green)
    after       "District 1" then "Tim Lauffer"      (Dunn)

`before` and `after` are the SAME EXTRACTION SHIFTED BY ONE, so a page read in
the wrong direction yields a full, plausible, entirely wrong roster: every
supervisor filed under their neighbour's district. Green County resolves 31 of
31 under both readings and they name different people. Detecting the direction
at runtime would mean a page tweak could silently flip it, so each county's
direction is PINNED here and a mismatch fails the county's count guard loudly
instead.

Two more shapes joined in the 2026-08-27 re-sweep, and both are pinned the
same way:

    column      a District COLUMN of bare numerals (Oneida, Price,
                Trempealeau) — see `_column`
    -strict     as before/after, but the scan STOPS at the next district line
                (Richland, Rusk, Shawano) — see `_windowed_strict`

A fifth joined on 2026-08-29 with Lafayette:

    same-line-lead
                the name FIRST and the district LAST, the office between them
                ("Larry Ludlum- Supervisor District #1") — see
                `_same_line_lead`. It is the only reading that recovers a ROLE
                from the seat's own row, because it is the only one that reads
                the words between the person and the district.

The strict readings exist because a district whose own row yields no readable
name reaches past the next heading and takes ITS name: Rusk prints an INDEX of
nineteen bare "District #N" links above its roster, and Richland's rows end in
an e-mail address. Both filed one person under two districts, both were caught
by the duplicate-name guard below, and neither ships. They are a separate
strategy rather than a change to `_windowed` so the twenty counties already
shipping keep byte-identical behaviour.

A COUNTY THAT DOES NOT FULLY RESOLVE YIELDS NOTHING. Partial output is worse
than none here: a card showing 18 of 21 districts reads as a complete board
with three empty seats.

OFFICERS PUBLISHED ABOVE THE DISTRICT LIST (added 2026-08-27)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Seven counties name their chair and vice-chairs in a block of their own rather
than beside the member's district row, so `split_role` — which only sees a role
attached to the name it is reading — never reached them. That is not cosmetic:
the county card's board chair is reconciled weekly against this roster, and a
roster with NO marked chair makes the officer builder WITHHOLD the Blue Book's
chair rather than supersede it. Attaching those roles took Juneau's and
Winnebago's cards from a withheld chair to the right one (the book still had
Timothy Cottingham and Thomas J Egan; their counties say Jim Cauley and Frank
Frassetto), and cut the withheld count from three to one.

`attach_officer_roles` joins on a UNIQUE FULL NAME and prints every join. It
never overwrites a role a member's own row already carries, and it walks into
the same before/after ambiguity the rest of this file pins per county — see
its comment for the three cases and for Jefferson, which a forward-only first
draft filed one seat off.

Vacancies are DATA, not misses. Winnebago district 33 ("Vacant Vacant"),
Shawano 5, Oneida 1 and Rusk 3 and 13 are seats the counties themselves say
nobody holds; they ship as vacant, and a vacancy overrides any name the search
window happens to reach. `vacant_districts` only scans FORWARD from the word
"district", which is why the strict and column readings report their own:
Shawano prints "Vacant ." ABOVE its "- District 5", and a column page names no
district beside a seat at all.

# fails loudly. Legistar is a witness and never a source — its OData date
# filter is silently ignored server-side (filter client-side) and its end
# dates can be aspirational.
#
# Outagamie is DELIBERATELY not here: its board moved to outagamie.gov,
# which answered one probe on 2026-08-25 and refused every later one
